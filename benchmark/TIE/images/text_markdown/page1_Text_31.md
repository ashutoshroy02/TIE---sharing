and 1.15 m (north-south) and
width 50 cm. This seems to be
an extension of wall no. 1 of XA-
9 and has the same structural
phases. It has been exposed to a
depth of 3.56 m. Courses are not
very clear. However the feature
of putting stretchers bricks
vertically is again repeated here.
From here the lane found in A-8
starts. The wall presently involves
Phase II and VI.
