and the north-eastern bastion
having two guard rooms in the
thickness of the fortification wall.
In Phase III the space was filled by
the construction of two sets of
houses having seven rooms on the
western side house and three rooms
and a courtyard on the eastern side.
These rooms might have been made
for storage purposes. In Phase III
and onwards up to phase IX, NS2
remained almost blocked but NS3
remained in use throughout. It is
supposed for security reasons only
one street was kept open for public
and vehicular traffic. The size of the
rooms on eastern and western sides
is as below :-
