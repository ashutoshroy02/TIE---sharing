14. Shape and other distinguishing
features: This trench in all the
quadrant has house walls of rooms
belonging to Phases V, VI, VII and
VIII. Through the various
structural phases this house
appears to be an important one.
While the house of Phase V has a
room with decorated tiled floors
having incised intersecting
circles, the room-walls of Phase
VII are not fully exposed and do
not give exact dimensions but the
rooms of Phase VIII are large ones
and one of the rooms has six large
jars embedded in earth, possibly
for storage of grains for the
household. The structures of
various phasesâ€™ which are
eighteen in number are described
as below :-

STR 1 Wall It is sealed by layer (1) and
layers (2) and (3) are contemporary
to it. It has three courses. Its
orientation is north-south. It is
8.25 m long and has a 70 cm
width.

STR 2 Wall It is sealed by layer (1) and
layers (2) and (3) are contemporary
to it. Its orientation is east-west.
It has length of 2.55 m and its
width is 70 cm. It has five
courses.

STR 3 and 4 Both are sealed by layer
(1) and layers (2) and (3) are
contemporary to them. Their

orientation are north-south.
combined length is 7.70 m and
the width is 70 cm.

STR 5 It is sealed by layer (1) and layers
(2) and (3) are contemporary to
it. Only two bricks are available
which indicate east-west
orientation of wall shown in doted
lines. It has length 40 cm and
width 20 cm.

STR 6 and 7 Walls These are sealed by
layer (1) and layers (2) and (3)
are its contemporary deposits.
These are made of headers and
stretchers and have five to six
courses. STR 6 and 7 are one
same wall have east-west
orientation. Combined length is
6.30 m and width is 55 cm.

STR 8 and 9 Floors These are
remnants of floors of the room
having dimensions in two
clusters (1) 1.50 x 1 m, (2) 1.60
m x 90 cm while STR-1, 2, 3 and
6 (green) make room having
length x width 3.80 x 2.55 m with
six storage jars for keeping
grains. Originally the room
appears to have a floor on bricks-
on-edge as remains of the same
are available in the southern
side. STR-1, 6 and 4 also make
a room having a length of 3.10
and width 2.60 m. The northern
wall is missing.

STR 4 and STR 7 are walls of the
room. Its western wall is completely
missing while northern side is
indicative of by two bricks. The exact
dimensions can not be discerned.
The fourth room is indicated by brick-
floors. This appears to be a four
roomed big house complex belonging
to Phase VIII.
