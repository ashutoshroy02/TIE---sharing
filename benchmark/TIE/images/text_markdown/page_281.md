13. State of preservation: Preservation
is good

14. Shape and other distinguishing
features: 3 constructional phases
are visible.

STR 1 Wall It is sealed by layer (1) and
its contemporary layers are (2) (3)
(4) & (5). Layer (6) goes below the

structural phase is Harappan,
Phase VI. Measurement of
structure is (a) length 2.50 m
continues but much eroded (b)
width 95 cm further continuing
in the section (c) height 95 cm.
Number of courses is ten.

west. Dimension of bricks: (a)
length 30 & 28 cm (b) width 15 &
14 cm (c) thickness 9 & 7.5 cm.

STR 2 Wall It is sealed by layer (1) and
contemporary layers are (2) (3)
(4) & (5). Its period and
structural phase is Harappan,
Phase VII. Measurement of
structure is (a) length 3.23 m
goes further on north section &
about STR 2 to south (b) width
83 cm is the longest width (c)
height 85 cm but further
excavated. Seven courses are
visible. Orientation of longer axis
is north- south. Dimension of
bricks: (a) length 30 cm (b) width
15 cm (c) thickness 7.5 cm.

STR 2 Wall It is sealed by humus and
its contemporary layers are (2) &
