Thus, the terraces studied in Sudanwala, Bata, Garibnath and Markanda provide an irrefutable geological evidence to suggest a course of a river that was flowing in almost west-northwesterly direction in the past. Its dimension was very large as it contained a very high discharge that traversed in its upper reaches a terrain of quartzite and metamorphic rocks. Such a region does exist in central and upper reaches of Yamun훮 fourth order basin where Central Crystallines and Jutogh group of rocks are located towards north, north-east and eastern side of above-mentioned four terraces.
Moreover, in the Paonta valley, there is a clear evidence that prior to the present Yamun훮 river, there existed a major river channel at a much higher elevation that followed a westerly and southwesterly course through a route now almost completely obliterated on Siwalik platform due to erosion but its terraces are still observed along Adi Badri-Markanda link in the plains immediately to the south of Siwalik belt.
