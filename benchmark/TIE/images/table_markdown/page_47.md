In spite of all the laurels that may
be showered on the C-14 method of dating
and its end-products, it is always
necessary to take these dates with a
pinch of salt. The lacunae clear when
we cast a closer glance at them. Thus,
for example, a 25th Century BCE horizon
is indicated for all the three levels, viz.
Early Sample Nos. TF-163, TF (BS)-163
and TF-607. Middle (Sample No. TF-948)
and Late (Sample Nos. TF-25, TF-153).
However, if we need not be so despondent.
Since if we go into the majority of the
dates in a given level, we find that the
picture is not so bleak. Thus, for the early
levels, out of the five dates only one (TF-
947) is in 22nd Century BCE, while three
(TF-607 and TF-163. TF-(BS) 163 are in
the 26th Century BCE and one (TF-160)
in the 27th Century BCE. This would imply
that the Mature Harappan settlement at
Kalibangan may have begun some time
in the 26th Century BCE.

Now to the likely date of the end of the
Mature Harappan settlement at
Kalibangan. Here we may straightaway
write off AD (TF-599) since it requires
no explanation to do so. One would have
given some credence to the two late dates,
viz. 1516 BCE (TF-244) and 1378/1345/
1319 BCE (TF-138), but these are heavily
out-voted by ten other dates, viz. TF-942.
TF-25. TF-153. P-481. TF 605. TF-150. TF-
149. TF(HS)- 149. TF-946 and TF-143. Of
these ten dates, the first nine fall
between the 20th and 26th Century BCE
and only one (TF-143) falls in the 19th
Century BCE. The consensus of all these
dates would, thus, indicate that the end
of the Mature Harappan settlement at
Kalibangan is not likely to be later than
the 20th Century BCE.
