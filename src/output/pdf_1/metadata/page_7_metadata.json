In it we had given an account of the settlement in so far as it related to the Early Harappan times (Period I). In the present volume, which consists of two parts, we place before the reader an account of the Mature Harappan settlement (Period II). We once again deeply apologize for the inordinate delay in the publication of these two volumes. which has been due to reasons beyond our control, as mentioned in the Preface to earlier volume. However, \"Better late than never\" is the maxim which gives us some solace, and we earnestly hope that the archaeological fraternity will forgive us for the delay."

He has taken pains to piece together the field-drawings, making them presentable. He has also analyzed the stratigraphy of the site, paying attention to each and every trench. Along with Ms Madhu Bala, he has examined the vast store of antiquities recovered from the site. selecting them for the purpose of this report and writing on them. Ms Madhu Bala has also written the chapters on small finds and pottery. Shri A.K. Sharma was in charge of the cemetery area and has contributed a detailed chapter on the burials, besides K.S. Ramachandran who has written on some of the pot-burials excavated by him. Prof. Bala Subramaniam of IIT and Jagat Pati Joshi have contributed a chapter on Harappan measuring instruments from Kalibangan. Way back, in 1955, the late Shri A. Ghosh had carried out explorations in certain parts of the Ghaggar and Drishadvati valleys and had duly recorded his findings in a diary. Since the material is related to the subject-matter of this Report, an opportunity is taken to include here his field-notes, along with a paper on the subject, which he presented at the All India History Congress, Jaipur, on December 29, 1951. Shri R.K. Sharma, has carried out detailed scientific studies of the fragments of the seals at the science laboratory of the Archaeological Survey of India, Dehradun (Uttarakhand)."

Further, since the report had to be submitted to the Director General, ASI, by the dead-line of May 2007 and most of the chapters poured in just before that, no worthwhile editing was possible. Thus, the reader is requested to look more for the contents of the chapters rather than go into the nuances of the style and language."
