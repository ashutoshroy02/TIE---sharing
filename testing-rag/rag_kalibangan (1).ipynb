In this series the first book on Early Harappans had already been published in 2003 by the Archaeological Survey of India as Memoir No 98.\\n\\nIn fact, after the partition (in 1947) extensive explorations were carried out in various places to search Harappan sites in India, since both the major Harappan sites, Mohenjodaro and Harappa, remained with the present‑day Pakistan. Kalibangan was the first Harappan site which was explored and subsequently excavated after Independence, in 1960‑69.', 'The excavations at Kalibangan have undoubtedly produced very good results and established Fabric A to F in pottery, added a unique finding of the earliest ploughed field from the early Harappan period and traces of earliest earthquake marking the end of the early Harappan and Harappan. Scale, cylindrical seal, charging bull, inscribed pottery, fire‑alters, wells, bathing platforms, linga‑with‑yoni, plumb bob, etc. are the noteworthy findings, along with the plans of citadel, the city and burial ground, from Harappan Period.\\n\\nHowever, for this long‑pending report and its enormous delay, the senior author, Prof. B. B. Lal, states in the Preface of the book: \"Better Late than Never\". The completion of the report has only been possible due to painstaking approach of the authors, after their retirements: Prof. B. B. Lal and Late Shri Jagat Pati Joshi, both former Directors General of Archaeological Survey of India.', 'This Part‑1 on the Harappans throws light on chronology; three‑mounds concept of the settlement; fortified citadel and city; stratigraphy and structures; chess‑board plan of the city; ritual platform, fire‑altars, wells; representative pottery, plain as well as decorated, with their design‑repertoire; cylindrical seal, square seals and sealings, with scientific studies of steatite seals; crafts and industries.\\n\\nThe academic community which has eagerly been waiting for this report for a long time will surely welcome it.', 'I have great pleasure in placing on record my appreciation of my colleagues in the Archaeological Survey of India, for their joint efforts for the completion of the report. My special thanks are due to Dr. B. R. Mani, Additional Director General, Dr. D. N. Dimri, Director (Publication), Shri Daljit Singh, Superintending Archaeologist (Publication), Shri Vishnu Kant, Assistant Superintending Archaeologist, Delhi Circle, Dr. Sujeet Nayan, Assistant Superintending Archaeologist (Publication), Shri Hoshiar Singh, Production Officer (Publication), Shri Abinash Mohanty, Assistant Archaeologist and others who have provided assistance with ardent zeal in bringing out this publication. M/s. Aravali Printers, New Delhi, deserve my thanks for their co‑operation and publishing this book.\\n\\nPlace: New Delhi\\n\\nDate: 31/01/2015\\n\\n(Rakesh Tewari)\\n\\nDirector General\\n\\nArchaeological Survey of India\\n\\n•\\n\\nPREFACE', 'Date: 31/01/2015\\n\\n(Rakesh Tewari)\\n\\nDirector General\\n\\nArchaeological Survey of India\\n\\n•\\n\\nPREFACE\\n\\nThe first volume of the report on the excavations at Kalibangan was prepared in 2000 and published by the Archaeological Survey of India in 2003. In it we had given an account of the settlement in so far as it related to the Early Harappan times (Period I). In the present volume, which consists of two parts, we place before the reader an account of the Mature Harappan settlement (Period II). We once again deeply apologize for the inordinate delay in the publication of these two volumes, which has been due to reasons beyond our control, as mentioned in the Preface to earlier volume. However, \"Better late than never\" is the maxim which gives us some solace, and we earnestly hope that the archaeological fraternity will forgive us for the delay.', 'As in the case of the earlier volume, in the present one too the credit of organizing the work must go primarily to Shri Jagat Pati Joshi. He has taken pains to piece together the field-drawings, making them presentable. He has also analyzed the stratigraphy of the site, paying attention to each and every trench. Along with Ms Madhu Bala, he has examined the vast store of antiquities recovered from the site, selecting them for the purpose of this report and writing on them. Ms Madhu Bala has also written the chapters on small finds and pottery. Shri A.K. Sharma was in charge of the cemetery area and has contributed a detailed chapter on the burials, besides K.S. Ramachandran who has written on some of the pot-burials excavated by him. Prof. Bala Subramaniam of IIT and Jagat Pati Joshi have contributed a chapter on Harappan measuring instruments from Kalibangan. Way back, in 1955, the late Shri A. Ghosh had carried out explorations in certain parts of the Ghaggar and Drishadvati', 'the late Shri A. Ghosh had carried out explorations in certain parts of the Ghaggar and Drishadvati valleys and had duly recorded his findings in a diary. Since the material is related to the subject-matter of this Report, an opportunity is taken to include here his field-notes, along with a paper on the subject, which he presented at the All India History Congress, Jaipur, on December 29, 1951. Shri R.K. Sharma has carried out detailed scientific studies of the fragments of the seals at the science laboratory of the Archaeological Survey of India, Dehradun (Uttarakhand).', 'Because of such a diverse authorship, it is but natural that the style of presentation and language vary from chapter to chapter. Further, since the report had to be submitted to the Director General, ASI, by the dead-line of May 2007 and most of the chapters poured in just before that, no worthwhile editing was possible. Thus, the reader is requested to look more for the contents of the chapters rather than go into the nuances of the style and language.\\n\\nAs the seniormost amongst the contributors, I have great pleasure in placing this report in the hands of the reader, hoping once again that we would be forgiven for the extraordinary delay.\\n\\nNew Delhi: May 30, 2007 B.B. Lal\\n\\nNO_CONTENT_HERE\\n\\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\\n\\nIn the preparation of this report technical assistance has been received from many persons and the authors would like to record their deep sense of gratitude and appreciation to them.', 'In the field, Sarvashri N.C. Ghosh, M.D. Khare, C. Margbandhu, J.S. Nigam, B.M. Pande, K. Raghavachary, J.P. Srivastava, K.M. Srivastava and I.K. Sharma, provided field supervision during nine seasons of work, besides students of batches from 1962 to 1969 of the School of Archaeology (now elevated to the Institute of Archaeology) and students of Punjab University, Chandigarh. The survey maps were prepared by Sarvashri S.P. Jain, A.K. Roy and late Vidya Ram. The drawings were prepared by late Rambabu, J.S. Dubey, L. Dutt, Lalit Jain, Mahendra Singh Panesar and late Amir Singh. Late B.P. Asthana, late R. Chatteijee, late V.V. Dutta, late Ranjit Gupta, Late M.B. Limaye and Shri G. Lakshmi Narayan did all the photography in the various field seasons.', 'In the headquarters, the supervision of drawing work, including their digitization was done by Shri Vijay Kumar. The digital drawings were prepared by Adwin Incorporation, Delhi, Shri Jassuram finalized the sections and S.K. Sharma prepared drawings of distribution map and charts of seals, sealing and graffiti. Shri Puran Chand Mukhia finalized all the drawings and made them press-ready. He also prepared many other drawings of beads and cemetery incorporated in the report. Shri Ramakant Dwivedi, and Dr. Khushal Girhe, of Prehistory Branch, Nagpur prepared drawings of the lithic tools. The small finds were photographed by B.R. Rajput, Ravindra Kumar and R.K. Jatta. The prints and digital photography of the small finds has been done by Rajat Dilwali of Ms. Kinsay Brothers, New Delhi. Shri Vishnu Kant provided assistance in the analysis of inscribed material and preparation of list of figures. Smt. Anjali Negi typed out the entire manuscript with care and precision and made it', 'of figures. Smt. Anjali Negi typed out the entire manuscript with care and precision and made it press-ready on computer. Various services were provided by Smt. Ramkali. Shri Narendra Kumar Sharma has been of considerable assistance in the location and recording of antiquities and pottery which have been stored for years at Purana Qila.', 'The work could not have been completed if Smt. Kasturi Gupta Menon, lAS and Shri Babu Rajeev, lAS, and the successive Directors General of ASI, had not provided the facilities and infrastructure to the authors at Purana Qila for writing the report. Dr. R.S. Fonia provided infrastructural help to the project. Shri A.K. Sinha, Director (Publication), Dr. B.M. Pandey and Dr. P.K. Trivedi, former Directors (Publication), Dr. Arundhati Baneiji (former Superintending Archaeologist), Dr. Madhulika Samanta (Superintending Archaeologist), Hoshiar Singh (Production Officer) and other officials of the Publication Section rendered valuable assistance. Finally we must say that this report is a joint effort of the entire team of technical hands who have put in combined effort for the completion of the project.\\n\\nNO_CONTENT_HERE\\n\\nCONTENTS\\n\\nPage', 'NO_CONTENT_HERE\\n\\nCONTENTS\\n\\nPage\\n\\na.

had given a detailed account of the location of the site and its environment, it may not be out of place here to recall some of it, since we don't expect the readers to remember all that; and perhaps some of them may not have even seen the earlier report.1\", \"Located on the left bank of the now-dry Ghaggar (ancient Sarasvati) river in Hanumangarh District of Rajasthan, Kalibangan (Lat. 29° 29 ' N; Long. 74° 08' E) is one of the most important sites excavated on the Indian side of the border after Independence. As would be seen a little later, it has made some very valuable contributions to our knowledge of the Harappan Civilization (also known as the Indus/Indus-Sarasvati Civilization). The site is about 6 km south of the nearest railway station, called Pilibangan, which lies between Hanumangarh and Suratgarh. From Delhi, it is a little over 300 km by road in a north-westerly direction (cf. Fig. 1.1).\", 'As one moves in this area, one sees during the winter season luscious fields of wheat interspersed with those of mustard, the latter welcoming the visitor by waving their lovely yellow flowers. But all this is a recent development. In the 1950s when we were exploring the area we were greeted by nothing but sand, often swirling up in the air and blinding us.', 'The ancient site consists of three mounds (Fig. 4.1). Of these, the one in the middle (called KLB-2) is the largest, though it has been badly eroded on the southern side. It measures approximately 240m east-west and seems to have been not less than 360m north-south. That on the west (called KLB-1) measures roughly 240m north-south and 120m east-west. As would have been observed, the longer axis in both the cases is north-south, i.e. almost at right angles to the adjacent river, which is somewhat unusual, since normally habitations stretch along the river. Anyway, both the mounds rise to a height of approximately 10m above the surrounding plains. The third mound, named KLB-3, is a bit away to the east of KLB-2 and is very much smaller in area, approximately 70m x 50m, and only 2.5m in height. The reason for this small size of the last-named mound lies in the fact that it was not a residential complex but was used only for a limited (ritualistic) purpose.', '1 B.B. Lal, J.P.

Period I, Early Harappan, datable to circa 3000-2700 BCE; and Period II, Mature Harappan, ascribable to circa 2600-2000 BCE, there being a gap of about a hundred years between the two. The settlement of Period I had to be abandoned around 2700 BCE because of an earthquake, the details of which have been given on pp. 99-100 of the earlier Report. However, here it may be well worth while to recall that this is the earliest evidence of an earthquake, recorded in any archaeological excavation.', 'Since the southern part of KLB-2 has considerably been eroded, it is difficult to estimate the original north-south extent of the settlement. However, as already stated, it is likely to have been about 360m. The fortification-walls on the east and west, though eroded, are traceable in their basal parts, indicating that the east-west extent of KLB-2 was around 240m. It may, incidentally, be added that the fortification-walls did not form a perfect rectangle on plan, but a parallelogram (Fig. 4.1). These walls were made essentially of mud bricks, although at one place a good deal of debris of kiln-fired bricks was also observed immediately by the side of the mud-brick wall, raising a question whether or not a burnt-brick revetment was also provided - maybe at some weaker points. Since the Mature Harappan settlement at Kalibangan lasted over half-a-millennium, parts of the fortification-walls which gave way in the course of time had to be renewed. In these rebuilt parts it was observed', 'which gave way in the course of time had to be renewed. In these rebuilt parts it was observed that whereas in the earlier construction the size of the bricks used was 10x20x40cm, in the later it was 7.5x15x30cm. However, no great importance need be attached to these sizes: in the initial stage the builders may have thought it appropriate to use large-sized bricks in the massive construction of the fortification and later on when only limited parts were reconstructed, smaller bricks may have been found good enough. It may, however, be added that the residential houses were made by and large of bricks of the smaller size, viz. 7.5x15x30cm.', \"Of the two parts of the new settlement, that on the east (KLB-2) was what may be called the 'general' habitation area, where merchants, agriculturists and other 'common men' had their houses. It has been nicknamed as the 'Lower Town', as against the other part which has been called the 'Citadel', having a relatively elevated position, high mud-brick-platforms bearing special kinds of structures on them, and a complex system of fortification-walls. (In fact, this kind of differential nomenclature was started long back (1946) when Wheeler duly established the presence of a fortification-wall around Mound AB at Harappa.) However, it is important to note that even of the gateways of the fortifications at least two were clearly identified, one in the north-western part, opening on the river-side, and another on the western side providing.\\n\\nExcavations at Kalibangan - The Harappans (1960-69)\", 'Excavations at Kalibangan - The Harappans (1960-69)\\n\\ncommunication with the Citadel, the northern part of which too had a gate on its eastern side. Though the relevant eastern part of KLB-2 was not excavated, it is possible that there was a gateway on this side as well, providing a passage towards KLB-3. Further, since the southern part of KLB-2 is completely eroded, nothing can be said about the existence of a gateway on this side, although common sense would argue for one.', 'It is interesting to note that the lanes/streets were laid out more or less in a set ratio of width, viz. 1:2:3:4, with the respective measurements being approximately 1.8m, 3.6m, 5.4m and 7.2m. Bullock-carts could easily ply through all these except the lane which was only 1.8m wide. An important feature was noticed at the crossing of the wider streets. At the exterior corners of the houses over there, wooden fender-posts were provided in order to protect the corners from being damaged by vehicular traffic (Fig. 6.46). Also, full care was taken by the civic authorities that no encroachments were made on the streets, although the site witnessed as many as nine structural phases accounting for a total vertical height of about 10m (Fig. 6.3). The only kind of construction to be seen in these streets was that of narrow platforms (chabutanzs) adjacent to the entrances to the houses, which seem to have been used by the occupants for a chit-chat with the neighbours, as is the case even now', 'to have been used by the occupants for a chit-chat with the neighbours, as is the case even now in the nearby villages. However, these streets are devoid of drains, such as one sees at Mohenjo-daro. The sullage, ejected through house-drains, was deposited in jars placed in pits immediately outside the house (Figs. 6.20 and 6.20(a)); arrangements, however, seem to have existed for the occasional cleaning of the jars.', 'The streets and lanes, mentioned earlier, divided the town into blocks, each block comprising a few houses. Though the size of the houses varied, depending evidently on the financial status of the respective owners, an average house appears to have consisted of a courtyard, on two or three sides of which there were the living rooms. Sometimes these could be two-deep, i.e. one behind the other. Piercing the wall on the fourth side of\\n\\nIntroduction And A Summary of the Results', 'the courtyard there was a large entrance. The large size of the entrance to these ancient houses may be understood by the analogy of the modem houses in the adjacent villages which too have such large entrances, through which bullock-carts are admitted into the courtyard and parked there. Maybe the same was the practice in the bygone days. Within the courtyard of these (ancient) houses have been discovered elongated troughs made of mud bricks, in a few of which there were also placed the broken lower halves of earthen jars. Once again, on the analogy of what obtains in the courtyards of houses in the adjacent villages, it may well be conjectured that in the third millennium BCE too the Kalibanganites provided fodder and drinking water in these troughs and pots for their cattle. In the courtyard of one of the houses has been discovered a well, lined with wedge-shaped bricks (Figs. 6.4 7 and 6.49), evidently for ready supply of water, even though the river was not far off. Steps in the', 'and 6.49), evidently for ready supply of water, even though the river was not far off. Steps in the courtyard, adjacent to one of the rooms, suggest that some of the houses may have been double-storeyed. The evidence available from a collapsed roof suggests that it was constructed by using wooden rafters, bamboos and reeds overlain with clay. Mention may also be made of a house which seems to have belonged to a well-to-do person. It had a flooring of kiln-fired terracotta tiles, decorated with a pleasing design of intersecting circles (Figs. 6.45 and 6.46(a)). In a nearby room there was a pile of jars, evidently used for the storage of grains (Fig. 6.45). Mud or mud bricks were commonly used for flooring purposes. However, in the upper levels of the site a very interesting feature was noted. Over here, the floors consisted of a soling of broken, burnt terracotta nodules interspersed with charcoal, over which was laid a layer of clay. When these were discovered we could not.', 'Another noteworthy feature of these altars was their placement. These were so located that anyone using them had to face the east—something which may have had an extra significance in the ritual. (Please mark a similar disposition of the seven contiguous fire-altars met with in the Citadel area (Figs. 5.42-5.44).\\n\\nExcavations at Kalibangan - The Harappans (1960-69)\\n\\nSome scholars have expressed a view that the fire-altars were cooking hearths. This is not tenable. In the first place, there already existed in the Kalibangan houses U-shaped hearths (chiilhas) used for cooking. Such chiilhas are in use even today and their rims provide a good base for the placement over them of the cooking vessels. On the other hand, the thin and tall stela, present in the centre of each fire-altar, cannot be expected to hold the base of a cooking pot. Why then shy away from accepting new evidence?', \"In marked contrast to the 'Lower Town' the western part (KLB-1) was consciously located on a higher ground provided by the ruins of the earlier occupation, so as to give it an eminence. As stated earlier, it is being called the 'Citadel'. It was surrounded by a fortification-wall, which covered an area of about 240m north-south and 120m east-west. Rectangular towers were also provided at the corners and on either side of the entrance on the southern side. The complex was further subdivided into two parts by an east-west medial wall, which too was provided with towers. The southern part had many platforms on which special structural features were located.\", \"Because of erosion over the millennia the evidence of the superstructures has been lost in many cases, but at least two of the platforms clearly showed religious association. On one of these, as many as seven contiguous 'fire-altars' were discovered. Though two of these have been disturbed by a subsequent drain, the central stela (now fallen) and fragments of terracotta 'cakes' were discovered in the others. Immediately to the south of these 'altars', the lower half of a jar was found embedded into the ground. It contained ash and charcoal, providing evidence that most probably fire was kept ready.\", \"That animal-sacrifice was a part of the Harappan rituals is indicated not only by certain scenes portrayed on the Harappan seals, but also by the engravings on a terracotta 'cake' found at Kalibangan itself. On one of its sides is depicted a human figure pulling forward an animal by a rope that had been tied around the latter's neck. On the other side is a deity which, on the basis of its posture and head-gear, seems to represent Siva, depicted on so many Harappan seals.\\n\\nThe platforms were separated from one another by passageways, to allow free movement of the worshippers. However, an important point to note is that the only entrance to this platform-complex (from the south), though wide enough, was in a stepped fashion. Such an arrangement debarred any vehicular traffic from getting.\\n\\nIntroduction And A Summary of the Results\", \"Introduction And A Summary of the Results\\n\\nen try into this complex. Indeed, this was idea of a 'procession' seems to find some sort of support from a seal from Mohenjo‑daro which depicts, in the upper register, a deity within a pipal‑leaf enclosure and kneeling devotee in front and, in the lower register, seven wig‑wearing figures, one behind the other, as if in a procession.\\n\\nThere was another access into this southern part; that was from the northern section, through the medial wall. But here again it was a stepped entry. So, even from this side vehicles were prohibited.\\n\\nIt would be of further interest to note that on the edge of one of the towers flanking the southern entrance there were post‑holes (Fig. 5.18(a)), suggesting that perhaps on certain ceremonial occasions flags were also flown, their staves being inserted into these holes.\", 'The northern part had an altogether different kind of planning. There were no platforms, but only residential houses, laid out on the two sides of a street that ran in a north‑westerly direction up to a gateway which opened on the river front. Some of these houses were very large, indicating that their occupants must have been some important personages. It has been surmised, though without any inscriptional corroboration, that they were probably priests who supervised the rituals performed on the platforms in the southern part of the complex.', 'There was yet another notable feature in the northern part. Between the medial wall, separating the above‑mentioned two parts, and the houses in northern part there was a mud‑brick paved street, running east‑west (fig. 5.26). If imagination is given further free run, it may well be that a procession led by the priests marched ceremoniously on this paved passageway and entered the southern part by means of the stepped passage through the medial wall, referred to in one of the preceding paragraphs.\\n\\nTo the east of the Lower Town, at a distance of about 80 metres, there was yet another complex, named KLB‑3. It covered an overall area of about 70 x 50m, of which only a part was excavated. In it no residential houses were met with, but only fire‑altars of which at least five examples were identified, wholly or\\n\\nExcavations at Kalibangan - The Harappans (1960-69)', \"Excavations at Kalibangan - The Harappans (1960-69)\\n\\nPartly. In these, the usual contents, namely a stela, terracotta 'cakes', ash and charcoal were found. Interestingly, a little away from the fire-altars a mud-brick wall was also discovered. Measuring 1.65 m in thickness, it was exposed to a length of about 12m. The exact purpose of this wall, however, remained to be determined. Whatever be the answer to this particular query, it is certain that these fire-altars were used by congregations and not individually by house-holders like the ones found in the Lower Town.\", \"At this point one might ask a question: While the presence of individual fire-altars in the houses in the Lower Town is easily explainable, what is the explanation for the provision of congregational fire-altars in the Citadel on the one hand and in KLB-3 on the other? A variety of guesses can be hazarded. Perhaps one of these may be that while the groups of the fire-altars perched on a high mud-brick platform in the well-fortified Citadel were to be used by the 'high-ups', those located in the lowly area of KLB-3 were meant for the lowly ones of the population, such as those living in the unfortified area to the south of the Citadel. There could be other explanations too, but, I am afraid, all these will remain in the realm of conjecture.\", 'Over a dozen examples of Type I graves were excavated. In all these cases the pit was rectangular, with either sharp or rounded-off corners and large enough to take in an extended human body. Usually placed at the bottom of the pit, the body lay supine in an extended position with the head to the north. The face could be skywards or turned to the left or right. In one case, the grave-pit was found lined with mud bricks which were also plastered (Figs. 22.40-22.43).', \"On the analogy of an example from Harappa, it may not be unjustified to assume that, overlying the grave, there may have been a mud-brick tumulus which, however, has since disappeared because of erosion. The body, as usual, lay supine in an extended pose, the head being to the north but turned westwards. An interesting feature of this grave was that it contained over seventy pots, nearly half of which lay to the north of the head and the rest underneath the body. It may also be noted that in another grave the body lay prone instead of supine and the head was to the south instead of north. Also, the legs and arms were somewhat folded. Had this kind of disposal any significance, or was it a mere aberration?\\n\\nR.E.M. Wheeler, 'Harappa 1946: The Defences and Cemetery R 37', Ancient India, No. 3, Pl. XXXVIII A.\\n\\nIntroduction And A Summary of the Results\", 'Within the same area as occupied earlier by the above‑mentioned inhumation graves (Type I), there lay graves which contained no human body‑either complete or even fractional (Type II). But these did contain the usual grave furniture, such as pottery, etc. Of this type, five examples were excavated. In one case, the pit measured 4x2xlm, the longer axis being north‑south. At the bottom were placed a large number of pots spread almost all over the area. As if to complete the grave‑furniture, there were three shell bangles too. Above this material were encountered a series of bands of sand and clay (Fig. 22.58) indicating that the pit remained open for some time, allowing this kind of deposit to accumulate. The pit was finally filled up with earth and clods thereof. In another example of this type, were found a shell bangle, a carnelian bead and a string of steatite beads, besides, of course the usual pottery. Overlying all this stuff were the inevitable bands of sand and clay. In a still', 'the usual pottery. Overlying all this stuff were the inevitable bands of sand and clay. In a still more interesting case, the pit measured 5m north‑south, 1.5m east‑west and 1.5m in depth, and, because of its extraordinary depth, was provided with two steps. The pottery and the conspicuously overlying bands of sand and clay were, of course, there. What could indeed be the reason for such graves sans any skeletal remains? Is it that the dead body was first laid in these graves and, after certain rituals, was removed to the regular inhumation graves? Indeed, one guess is as good or bad as another.', 'Another kind of burial (Type III) encountered so far only at Kalibangan, is equally baffling. In this case, the grave‑pits were circular or ovoid, but never rectangular. More importantly, these also did not contain the dead body. However, the siting of these pits not far away from the other two kinds of graves referred to did not also show up the kinds of bands of sand and clay as were encountered in the graves of Type II. Thus, the functions of Types II and III were clearly different from each other. Could the Type III have been of a somewhat symbolic nature, perhaps associated with those who died elsewhere? Only further work would be able to throw some light on this issue.', \"The skeletal remains from the graves of Type I have thrown some interesting sidelight. The skull of a child was found to be rather unusually large, perhaps resulting from the accumulation of water in the brain cells - a hydrocephalic case? To treat the same, the Kalibangan 'surgeon' took recourse to trephination, piercing three holes on the right temporal region and branding it with some heated instrument. An example of trephination also comes from Lothal.\\n\\n4 S.R. Rao, 1979, Lothal 1955-62, Vol. I, pp. 145‑46. New Delhi: Archaeological Survey of India.\\n\\nExcavations at Kalibangan - The Harappans (1960-69)\\n\\nIn yet another case, a male skeleton bore cut marks near the left knee. The size of the cut incidentally corresponds to that of the blade of an average copper axe of the Harappan period. Perhaps in the course of a quarrel the person was hit by his adversary with an axe, as a result of which there may have been excessive bleeding and the person succumbed to the injury.\", 'After a study of the skeletons, A.K. Sharma states that the average height of an adult male ranged between 1.55m and 1.75m and of the females between 1.45m and 1.55m. He is also of the view that life-expectancy may not have been more than 55-60 years (cf. Chapter 22).', 'Like any other Harappan site, Kalibangan too yielded a rich harvest of pottery and antiquities. As regards the pottery, it may be stated that since the site was re-occupied hardly within a century of its abandonment by the Early Harappans, the lower levels of KLB-2 contained a mix-up of Early Harappan and Mature Harappan pottery. The former, however, petered out as time passed and only the latter continued. This latter was very profuse and showed a rich variety of painted designs (Chapter 8). The antiquities included, as usual, seals, sealings, inscribed pottery, copper objects, a variety of beads, chert blades and other tools, terracotta figurines and the ubiquitous cakes, etc. All these have been described in the respective chapters. Here we may refer to just a few of them which merit special attention.', \"Amongst the seals there is one which is cylindrical in shape and is engraved with an interesting scene (Fig. 9.51). At least shape-wise, though not subject-wise, it reminds us that it is a type which, like the cylinder seal referred to earlier, is unusual in a Harappan assemblage and shows West Asian contacts. Also noteworthy is the occurrence of seven terracotta 'tablets'. These are thin oblong strips, well-fired, bearing in all cases the same inscription and the horn of a unicorn (Figs. 9.77-9.79). These do not bear any impressions of reed or cord on the reverse, as the normal sealings do. Thus, their purpose seems to have been altogether different. In this context, it may be added that all these came from the Citadel, more importantly from an area lying between the ritualistic platforms on the one hand and the houses to the north which may have been occupied by the priests and other elites. Could these then have some kind of special (religious?) significance?\", 'Of the inscribed pottery there are at least two examples which deserve special attention. On these the inscriptions were engraved after firing and the noteworthy point is that the signs partially overlap. It has been observed that in all the cases concerned the sign on the right is overridden by the next one on the left. This shows that in each case the sign on the right was inscribed first and then came the one on the left. Such a disposition of the signs conclusively proves that the direction of writing in the Harappan script was from the right to the left (Figs. 9.144 and 9.148).', 'Amongst the other objects, particularly noteworthy is a terracotta example of the Uriga-cum-yoni (Fig. 21.75). Although stone examples, separately of the liriga and yoni, had been found at Mohenjo-daro, this is an example wherein the two go together. Two bulls, one in terracotta (Fig. 21.16) and the other in bronze (Fig. 12.15) are very good examples of Harappan art. Special attention also needs to be drawn to a terracotta kemos, with seven lamps set on the hollow ring (Fig. 21.76) - a type which, like the cylinder seal referred to earlier, is extraneous to the usual Harappan repertoire and points towards West Asian contacts.\\n\\nSOME THOUGHTS ON\\n\\nTHE NOW-DRY RIVER ON WHOSE BANK STANDS THE SITE OF KALIBANGAN\\n\\nB.B. LAL\\n\\nITS IDENTIFICATION', 'THE NOW-DRY RIVER ON WHOSE BANK STANDS THE SITE OF KALIBANGAN\\n\\nB.B. LAL\\n\\nITS IDENTIFICATION\\n\\nThe ancient site of Kalibangan stands on the left bank of a river which is now dry, though its bed is about 5 kilometres wide at this point and has been measured even up to 8 km in width elsewhere (cf. Fig. 2.1). Its present name in the Kalibangan region is the Ghaggar but downstream in Cholistan (Pakistan) it is known as the Hakra. Still further down, in Sindh, it goes by yet different names, such as the Raini, Wahinda and Nara. There is geomorphological evidence to show that the river fell into the Rann of Kachchha, an arm of the Arabian Sea (Fig. 2.2).', \"However, it is very difficult to find out why and when this same river was given these altogether different names in the various regions. And more important is the question: What was its name when it was flowing and was the life-line of the Early and Mature Harappan people whose settlements, dating back to at least the fourth millennium BCE, prospered all along its bank?\\n\\nPerhaps we have to get back to ancient Indian literature in search of the answer. The earliest text, the Rigveda, has a very famous hymn known as the Nadi-stuti, i.e. 'Prayer to the Rivers'. Its verses, relevant to the present context, run as follows:\\n\\n1 Louis Flam. 1999.

Thereafter it joins the Ghaggar and the combined Sarasvati-Ghaggar stream dries up near Sirsa. Beyond that it is only the dry bed that is identifiable, through Rajasthan, Cholistan and Sindh down to the Rann of Kachchha, as already mentioned earlier.\\n\\nA question may well be asked: Since as of now the Sarasvati-Ghaggar combine does not carry plenty of water and dries up beyond a certain point, how come that the dry bed is so wide, sometimes, as already stated, up to 8 km? In search of the answer, we have once again to get back to the Rigveda. Verse RV 6. 61.2 states:\\n\\niyam SU$mebhirbisakha ivarujat sanu giril)am tavi$ebhiriirmibhibl paravataghnimavase suvriktibhi.b Sarasvatima vivasema dhitibhi/11\\n\\nThis (Sarasvati river) has shattered the mountain peaks with her fast and powerful waves, just (as easily) as one uproots the lotus stems; let us invoke her, who strikes what is far and near, with holy hymns and prayers.', 'Again, RV 6.61.8 endorses that: yasyii ananto arhutastve$a§chari$1)Uran;ava)l ~charatiroruvatll\\n\\nWhose (i.e. of the Sarasvati) boundless, impetuous and swift-moving flood gushes forth with tempestuous roar.\\n\\nFrom the foregoing it would be abundantly clear that the Rigvedic Sarasvati had plenty of water in it, so much so that its fast and powerful currents could sometimes even shatter the peaks of mountains.\\n\\nThat this river flowed all the way down to the sea is also duly vouchsafed by the...\\n\\nSome thoughts on Now-Dry River on whose Bank Stands the Site of the Kalibangan valley.\\n\\nAs regards the Sutlej having fed the Sarasvati, a noteworthy objection comes from J. Wilson. He draws attention to the absence of any Sutlej-like sandy silt in the bed of the Hakra (by which name the ancient Sarasvati is known in Cholistan) a fact demonstrating that the Sutlej did not join the Sarasvati.', 'While it is not proposed to examine here in detail the veracity or otherwise of the Yamuna and Sutlej having fed the ancient Sarasvati, some very elementary points in any case cannot be ignored. No doubt the Drishadvati was a tributary of the Sarasvati in ancient times, as per the Rigvedic text itself, but this former river called Sudanwala. It joins the Ghaggar-Sarasvati combine all the way down near Suratgarh. Thus, it could not have contributed its water to the Sarasvati before that point.', 'Now to the Sutlej. It is believed that in antiquity of course, it flowed successively through what are now known as Eastern Naiwal, Naiwal and Western Naiwal. However, it is well known that even the Eastern Naiwal comes neighbouring area. But when it joined, if it really did, the Ghaggar-Sarasvati combine around Hanumangarh. Thus, neither the Yamuna nor the Sutlej contributed even a drop of water to the Sarasvati during its journey right from the Siwaliks up to Hanumangarh - a stretch of nearly 400 kilometres in which there lay a large number of Early and Mature Harappan sites, such as Kunal, Banawali, etc.', 'In this context one can do no better than to refer to a most recent study of the problem. It is by two eminent geologists, V.M.K. Puri and V.C. Verma. In their paper, they present a very comprehensive survey of the area involved. However, we give here a brief summary of their findings. The mountainous terrain between the Yamuna and Markanda shows a series of four river-terraces. The authors have numbered these, from top downwards, as T0, T1, T2 and T3. The oldest of these terraces, viz. T0, has been identified at a distance of about 2 kilometres south-southeast of a place that rises to an average height of 660 metres above the mean sea-level (MSL). An important feature of this terrace is that it contains quartzite pebbles and metamorphic rocks, besides, other material. With similar lithological composition, high terraces, T1 and T2 have also been observed.', \"It has been noted that the kind of exclusive material just referred to in the context of the older terraces does not occur in them. The implications of such a difference in the lithological composition in the respective sets of terraces are of far-reaching significance, and it would be best to quote what these geologists have to say (ibid., p.16).\\n\\nFootnotes:\\n\\nM.A. Courty. 1985.

Its dimension was very large as it contained a very high discharge that traversed in its upper reaches a terrain of quartzite and metamorphic rocks. Such a region does exist in central and upper reaches of Yamuna fourth order basin where Central Crystallines and Jutogh group of rocks are located towards north, north-east and eastern side of above-mentioned four terraces. Moreover, in the Paonta valley, there is a clear evidence that prior to the present Yamuna river, there existed a major river channel at a much higher elevation that followed a westerly and southwesterly course through a route now almost completely obliterated on Siwalik platform due to erosion but its terraces are still observed along Adi Badri-Markanda link in the plains immediately to the south of Siwalik', 'are still observed along Adi Badri-Markanda link in the plains immediately to the south of Siwalik belt.', \"Some Thoughts on Now-Dry River on whose Bank Stands the Kalibangan\\n\\nIn search of the source of this once-mighty river, these geologists draw our attention to the Tons basin where quartzite and metamorphic rocks abound. They then aver: 'All the evidences point to only one conclusion that the present-day Tons was in fact Vedic Sarasvati in its upper reaches.' (ibid., p.16).\", 'After a further study of the region, these geologists produced a map which shows that the ultimate sources for this Vedic Sarasvati were what are known today as the Sarasvati, Jamadar, Supin and Manjee Glaciers, supplemented by Rupin and Nargani Glaciers. All these glaciers melted near Naitwar and the river thus formed moved first in a southwesterly direction and then in the westerly. Breaking through the Siwaliks near Adh Badri, it finally made its mighty descent on the plains (Fig. 2.3). This, in brief, is the story of perennial water supply to the once mighty Sarasvati which is now represented by mere dry beds, though, as already stated, these are at places as wide as 6-8 kilometres.\\n\\nHOW AND WHEN DID THE SARASVATI DRY UP?', \"HOW AND WHEN DID THE SARASVATI DRY UP?\\n\\nA very relevant question that may now be asked: If the Sarasvati was such a mighty river, how did it dry up? The answer, again, had to be sought through an investigation of the Himalayan Terrain, which the afore-mentioned geologists, Puri and Verma, verily did. According to them, there took place a major seismic upheaval in the Himalayas, as a result of which there arose the Bata-Markanda Divide, nearly 30 metres in height (Fig. 2.4). It blocked the passage of the Sarasvati, which could no longer flow westwards. Since water must find its way out, it flowed backwards and, taking advantage of the Yamuna Tear opening, ended up in a normal process.\\n\\nFurther, as Raikes has very aptly captioned his paper just referred to, viz. 'Kalibangan: Death from Natural causes', the Harappan settlement at Kalibangan came to a sudden end because of the drying up of the Ghaggar, even though it was still in a Mature stage and not decaying.\", '6 Robert Raikes, 1968.

While geologists have not yet come up with any precise dating, archaeologists do have some noteworthy facts and figures to advance, based upon the radiocarbon method of dating. From the data given in detail in Chapter 3, it would be seen that the Mature Harappan settlement at Kalibangan came to a sudden end around 2000 BC. In other words, this was the time when the Sarasvati dried up.\\n\\nThe Emergent Picture\\n\\nFrom what has been stated in the preceding pages the following facts emerge, namely that -\\n\\nThe now-dry Ghaggar on whose bank Kalibangan stands was none other than the Sarasvati of the Rigveda;\\n\\nIt originated in the Himalayas and flowed all the way down to the sea;', \"It originated in the Himalayas and flowed all the way down to the sea;\\n\\nIt dried up because of a tectonic upheaval in the Himalayan region which threw up a barrier known as the Bata-Markanda Divide, with the result that the path of the Sarasvati was blocked and its water got diverted to the Yamuna via the Yamuna Tear;\\n\\nThis drying up of the Sarasvati led to the abandonment of the Mature Harappan settlement at Kalibangan - an event that took place around 2000 BCE, as testified to by the radiocarbon dates.\\n\\nSince the Sarasvati was a mighty river flowing during the Rigvedic times and it dried up around 2000 BCE, the Rigveda has got to be earlier than 2000 BCE. How much earlier, it is anybody's guess.\\n\\nAccording to the famous Nadi-stuti Siikta of the Rigveda (RV 10.75.5-6), the area occupied by the Rigvedic Aryans extended from the upper reaches of the Ganga - Yamuna on the east to the Indus and its western tributaries on the west.\", 'A simple question is now posed, viz. which archaeological culture flourished in this very area during the pendency of the Rigvedic times, i.e. prior to 2000 BCE? The inescapable answer will have to be: The Harappan Culture. In other words, the Harappan Culture and Vedic Culture are just two faces of the same coin (Fig. 2.6).\\n\\nFrom time to time certain objections have been raised against the equation set forth in (iii) above. I have dealt exhaustively with the same in my book, The Sarasvati Flows On: The Continuity of Indian Culture (2002; New Delhi: Aryan Books International) and I do not propose to burden the reader by re-hashing the same here.

LAL\\n\\nThen in the 1920s the Harappan Civilization was discovered it was but much older than the actual time when the wood was burnt, turning it into the charcoal picked up for dating.\\n\\nBesides the foregoing, there have been changes in the half-life value of the carbon as also in the methods of calibration. Thus, at one point of time the half-life value stood at 5568, whereas later on it was upgraded to 5730. In so far as the calibrations are concerned, there have been three so far. As of now, the latest one (Calib-3) is considered to be the most reliable (perhaps awaiting the arrival of a fourth one!). Anyway, this is the one in use now, and is being adopted here in the case of Kalibangan as well.', \"Now we have a method called the Radiocarbon Method, by which organic material, such as charcoal, wood, bone, etc., occurring in various strata is dated, giving what is generally regarded as a method of 'absolute dating'. In this context, however, it needs to be added that though relatively more reliable than the mere 'comparative method', even this method has its own pit-falls. For example, often charcoal samples, on the basis of which the dating rests, have been found contaminated either by roots of living trees which have gone all the way down intermixing with the samples concerned or by the seepage into and consequent absorption by these samples of water containing much later carbonaceous material. Such a mix-up will naturally give a much younger date, dependent on the degree of contamination. On the other hand, the radiocarbon dates can also be thrown back by centuries if the charcoal is contaminated.\", \"We have altogether 28 dates for Period II (i.e. Mature Harappan) of Kalibangan. Based on their stratigraphic horizons, 5 of these samples belong to the Early Levels, while 10 and 13 respectively to Middle and Late. Initially, all these samples were examined by the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research, Bombay and are prefixed with TF in the Table below. However, there is one sample which bears 'P' as a prefix, which stands for the Laboratory of the University of Pennsylvania, where the dating of this particular sample was done.

This becomes clear when we cast a closer glance at them. Thus, for example, a 25th Century BCE horizon is indicated for all the three levels, viz. Early (Sample Nos. TF-163, TF-(BS) 163 and TF-607), Middle (Sample No. TF-608) and Late (Sample Nos. TF-25, TF-153). However, we need not be so despondent, since if we go into the majority of the dates in a given level, we find that the picture is not so bleak. Thus, for the Early Levels, out of the five dates only one (TF-947) is in 22nd Century BCE, while three (TF-607 and TF-163, TF-(BS) 163 are in the 25th Century BCE, and one (TF-160) in the 26th Century BCE. This would imply that the Mature Harappan settlement at Kalibangan may have begun some time in the 26th Century BCE.', 'Now to the likely date of the end of the Mature Harappan settlement at Kalibangan. Here we may straightaway write off AD 80 (TF-599) since it requires no explanation to do so. One would have given some credence to the two late dates, viz. 1516 BCE (TF-244) and 1378/1345/1319 BCE (TF-138), but these are heavily out-voted by ten other dates, viz. TF-942, TF-25, TF-153, P-481, TF-605, TF-150, TF-149, TF(BS)-149, TF-946 and TF-143. Of these ten dates, the first nine fall between the 26th and 20th Century BCE and only one (TF-143) falls in the 19th Century BCE. The consensus of all these dates would, thus, indicate that the end of the Mature Harappan settlement at Kalibangan is not likely to be later than the 20th Century BCE.\\n\\n0\\n\\nTHE HARAPPAN SETTLEMENT AT KALIBANGAN- AN OVERVIEW\\n\\nJAGAT PATI JOSHI', \"0\\n\\nTHE HARAPPAN SETTLEMENT AT KALIBANGAN- AN OVERVIEW\\n\\nJAGAT PATI JOSHI\\n\\nThe Harappan settlement at Kalibangan, (Lat. 29°29'N; Long. 74°08'E, Survey Sheet 44 K/SW). District Hanumangarh, Rajasthan is situated on the left bank of the Sarasvati and has been found spread in three mounds presently designated as KLB‑1, KLB‑2 and KLB‑3 having an area of approximately 600 m x 450 m (Fig. 4.1). While in KLB‑1 the Harappan settlement is on the top of Early Harappan occupation, KLB‑2 has given the evidence of Early Harappans and Harappans living together up to middle levels and KLB‑3 has seven fire altars of different types by the side of an enclosure wall and yielded overwhelming Harappan pottery with some Early Harappan pottery indicating use of ritualistic structures by both. It has no residential structures (Figs. 4.2 and 4.3).\", 'The northern half on the other rhomb, consisted of residential buildings, perhaps of the elite and had its own street plan with three to four entrances. The fortification wall surrounded the entire citadel having three bastions in the northern side and two salients in the western side with a main stepped entrance on the southern side and a bipartite wall between the two rhombs having two salients and two bastions on the sides having a stepped brick on edge ramp for connecting the two parts. There are two corner bastions on the southern side and one salient and other having an entrance between the two projecting salients steps.', 'When the settlement of Early Harappans had reached an average height of 1.60 m above the natural surface, the mound was temporarily abandoned as indicated by thin sandy layers following a seismic catastrophe as evidenced by the faulty strata and Wted one arm of the gateway. The mound was soon re‑occupied by the Harappans and thereafter the structural character of this mound was changed.

No remains of the south-western corner were traced. It was found that a large part of the structure had been completely eroded away. Between the latter and the central salient was exposed another projecting structure retaining four post-holes on the outer edge of the masonry. Its relationship with the fortification nearby and the precise function of the post-holes, have not yet been elucidated.

On the southern side, where its vestiges were easily identified, the wall was excavated to a fortification of over 100 m continuous length salients and a rectangular tower. Two sets of brick sizes (40x20x10 and 30x15x7.5 em), representing margin of couple structural phases, were two principal masonry of this wall. In the earlier phase, the width of the wall showed the use of larger-sized bricks, 7 m, while in the latter, employing the smaller-sized bricks, the width was measured between 9 and 11 m. At some places, further structural sub-division could also be differentiated in the latter phase. The salient projecting 9.35 m from the main face was 17 m and rose imposingly with a battered exterior. Of the south-western corner tower only the projection side was available, the remaining angles being insufficiently preserved.\\n\\n2', '2\\n\\nAt KLB-2, the excavation uncovered an area of the township with its characteristic chess-board plan. Four arterial thoroughfares running north-south have so far been excavated, and it is surmised that within the unexcavated width of the mound two, if not three, more may be found. The width of the streets and thoroughfares ranged between 1.80 and 7.20 m and significantly enough approximated to the unit of about 1.80 m. While the north-south thoroughfares were found to run unimpeded, the east-west running lanes or streets did not cut across the former and were staggered in plan. Apart from rectangular platforms, no other encroachment was noticed in the thoroughfares and streets. In this typical grid layout of the township, each house faced at least two, if not three, streets, and with a rectangular plan, consisted of a courtyard often with a well and six or seven rooms aligned on the three sides. Within one of the rooms of almost each house was found the.\\n\\nFootnote', 'Footnote\\n\\nFrom the sites reported, only three excavated sites show the general layout of a \"Citadel\" and \"Lower Town\" (Fig. 1,2,3).

That of Kalibangan is smaller (150 by 300 m). At Mohenjo-daro the \"Citadel\" covers 1/7 of the whole area, at Harappa 1/6 and at Kalibangan 1/3 of it.

At some places, the wall was found to be built on a fairly deep foundation, necessitated perhaps by the uneven and riven surface of the abandoned Early Harappan settlement. The width of the wall, which as elsewhere, showed two principal structural phases ranging between 4 and 5 m. The full length of the eastern side including the north-eastern turn was exposed; this side of the mound is very badly eroded, especially on the lower slopes; only the inner face of the fortification-wall was available, indicated at some places by the bottom course alone. Save at one place, the outer face was too eroded for determining the width of the wall or other features. At the north-eastern turn, the outer angles of the fortification-wall are insufficiently preserved to indicate its dimensions, much less any plan of the corner-tower.', '(i) THE FORTIFICATION\\n\\nThe citadel-mound (KLB-1) had already indicated the existence of the fortification-wall on the northern side of the northern half, which was thus shown to be similarly enclosed as the southern half. The entire length of the fortification-wall on the northern side, including the north-western corner bastions was exposed, the details of the north-eastern corner, being insufficiently preserved, remaining undetermined. The wall was found to run parallel to the partition-wall up to a length of about 85 m. from the eastern end; thereafter showed a re-entrant angle within which was located an unpretentious entrance. At the turning, this re-entrant was further marked by a salient in plan, projected nearly 6 m from the main wall. The north-western corner tower showed two projections on the northern side.\\n\\nNORTHERN SIDE', 'NORTHERN SIDE\\n\\nOn the northern side, stretches of the wall were traced to its entire length, and it was found that the wall was built on the existing slope of the preceding occupation, which was often cut through or displaced for the foundations. The inner face of the fortification-wall bore mud-plaster, suggestive of its standing height above the inside ground level. On this side also it was seen that the mud-brick platform within the citadel-complex was not of one build structurally with the fortification-wall, at least in the earlier phase. A reasonably well-preserved angle of a massive mud-brick platform, separated from the fortification-wall by a 2.20 m. wide passage, was exposed to establish the above premises.\\n\\nR | V\\n\\n1\\n\\nGROUP-A\\n\\nGROUP-B\\n\\nENTRANCE\\n\\nGROUP-C\\n\\nGROUP-E\\n\\nPLATFORM A\\n\\nGROUP-F\\n\\nGROUP G\\n\\nPLATFORM-D\\n\\n1\\n\\nUl\\n\\nPLATFORM-E\\n\\nGROUP-J\\n\\nVALIBANGAN 1960-69\\n\\nJStRICT HANUMANGARH RAJASTHAN\\n\\n1B-1\\n\\nGROUP-K\\n\\nPLATFORM-F\\n\\nENTRANCE\\n\\nFic:\\n\\n96564\\n\\nKLB-1 Stratigraphy and Structures', '1B-1\\n\\nGROUP-K\\n\\nPLATFORM-F\\n\\nENTRANCE\\n\\nFic:\\n\\n96564\\n\\nKLB-1 Stratigraphy and Structures\\n\\nFig. 5.8 KLB 1 Tunnel section below the Harappan (Period II) fortification wall on the north showing two successive phases of the early Harappan (Period I) fortification wall, looking north-west\\n\\n47\\n\\nExcavations at Kalibangan - The Harappans (1960-69)\\n\\nFig. 5.9\\n\\nKLB I Bastion on the southern side\\n\\nFig. 5.10\\n\\nKLB 1 Part view of the bastion on the southern side showing structures of different phases\\n\\n48\\n\\nKLB-1 Stratigraphy and Structures\\n\\nFig. 5.11 KLB 1 Close-up of batter of the wall northwestern corner tower\\n\\n49\\n\\nExcavations at Kalibangan - The Harappans (1960-69)', '49\\n\\nExcavations at Kalibangan - The Harappans (1960-69)\\n\\nFortification-wall at some places, notably in the central part of its length, showed a battered angle both on the exterior and the interior faces, the taper being obtained by thick coating of mud plaster.

The western end of this wall is incompletely preserved, both its inner and outer angles being absent. Nevertheless, at the north-western turn, remains of an impressive structure, perhaps part of a corner-tower with a battered exterior were brought to light.

The outside face of this wall seems to have originally been plastered with mud, patches of which were still found at places.\\n\\nWESTERN SIDE\\n\\nDespite patient search, no traces of the fortification-wall have been found on the western side beyond the turn of the corner tower. It may be recalled that no turning or re-entrant of the fortification was noticed at the south-western corner as well. The western side of the mound is badly riven by flood-water and modern depredations. It is likely, therefore, that all vestiges of the fortification-wall on this side have been completely lost due to erosion.', 'On the western side, however, further attempts to trace the outline of the Harappan fortification wall, further west of the already-trenched area, revealed the existence of an Early Harappan fortification-wall.

In this entrance-complex again, two structural phases were recognized, of which the earlier consisted of steps of brick (size: 40x20x10 em; riser, 10 em and tread 40 em), and the latter, perhaps of a ramp, screened by a 1.50 m wide wall (brick size: 30x15x7.5 em). The site of an entrance belonging to the later phase of the fortifications was duly located on the southern side, between the central salient and the south-western end. This entrance by virtue of its being an impressive baked brick structure seems to have suffered very badly from modern despoliations. The passage-floor or steps along with its flanking masonry, which were of burnt bricks.', \"In this connection a few more points may be noted. Entry to the southern rhomb was through two gates, one each on the south and the north. Both the gates were flanked by salient, but the relevant point here is that in both cases there were steps leading up to the actual point of entry through the fortification-wall. Such provision clearly precluded the entry of any vehicular traffic into the southern rhomb. And perhaps this was as it should have been, for no one would appreciate people riding about in vehicles through what may perhaps more appropriately be termed a 'Temple-complex'.\", \"The two entrances while having the common feature of being flanked by salient and provided with steps, showed some noteworthy difference in details. Thus, the staircase leading to the northern entrance was made of mud-brick alone and was not very wide, that on the southern side had mud-brick soiling with burnt-brick veneer, was much wider and had provision for a few landings too. This difference is understandable in the context of the relative use of the two entrances; viz. while the one on the northern side was used by only a limited number of people residing in the northern rhomb, that on the southern side was the real public entry, for all those coming from the 'Lower Town', as well as from the area immediately to the south of the southern rhomb itself. The burnt-brick veneer was evidently provided to meet the much greater wear and tear at this entrance.\", 'In the context of the southern entrance, it may also be noted that on a footing to the east of the two salients flanking it, there were a few regularly spaced circular holes. While more of these holes could not be identified owing to large-scale spoliation of this as well as the western salient, it would appear that these were deliberately planned: a probable use might have been to insert poles, carrying banners at the top. Such a conjecture would seem to fit in with the public religious festivities which are likely to have taken place in the southern rhomb from time to time.', \"On the northern side of the southern rhomb, almost alongside the exterior face of its fortification-wall, there was a sufficiently wide mud-brick-on-edge pavement. It commenced near the eastern end and, on the basis of the few rows of brick-on-edge found along the exterior of the eastern of the two central salient, may be assumed to have run up to the flight of steps which led to the entrance into the southern rhomb from this side. One is tempted to surmise that on specified.\\n\\nKLB-1 Stratigraphy and Structures\\n\\noccasions, there marched, on this paved pathway, a procession of priests, perhaps led by the high priest, and walking up along the flight of steps it entered the 'temple complex' of the southern rhomb, where the priests ascended one or separate platforms to perform or preside over the rituals. The laity by then had perhaps already gathered within the complex, entering it through the southern gate.\", \"It has already been mentioned above that though the northern rhomb was also fortified, the fortification-wall in its case was, as it were, a supplement or extension of that surrounding the southern rhomb. (It may be recalled that the two central salients of the bipartite wall projected outwards into the northern rhomb, which gave the southern rhomb its primary status.) Within the northern rhomb there were no platforms, no congregational 'fire-altars', no sacrificial pits, but only residential houses planned on either side of a street which, starting off from near the eastern of the two central salients of the bipartite wall led to a river-side exit on the north-west. In these houses there evidently dwelt the priests and others connected with the administering of the rituals in the southern rhomb. There are a number of bath platforms, drains and an imposing double storeyed home perhaps belonging to an important person. One may also reasonably infer that in a priest-dominated society,\", 'belonging to an important person. One may also reasonably infer that in a priest-dominated society, such as the Indus one seems to have been, the civic administration also may have been handled, partly, largely or even wholly by these very priests. However, how priesthood was handed down and how the head priest, if any, was appointed will remain matters for guess work, at least until the seals begin to speak; or may be these too remain silent on this particular point.', \"In view of the foregoing, would it not be desirable to re-think about calling the western wing of the settlement the 'Citadel'— a term which usually implies a fortified seat of the king of chieftain in a purely political sense? To continue to regard it as the 'Citadel' would be to continue absorbing to the Indus Civilization, a polity, which the evidence does not seem to warrant. And it is this concept of the 'Citadel', which has been magnified into regarding it a 'well protected government headquarters either central or provincial'.\", 'A large number of structures have been found at the citadel mound KLB-1 at Kalibangan during the Harappan Period. These have been designated in a two fold method, (i) The prominent structures, fortification wall, entrances, bipartite wall, bastions are marked as such and described; (ii) The other structures are marked and described groupwise. The various platforms in the ritualistic area are alphabetically marked and described in the catalogue.

On it were noted only a well and a \\'fire-altar\\', but something more: it was a rectangular pit, measuring 1.25 x 1m and lined with kiln-burnt bricks. Within it lay bovine bones and antlers, evidently representing some kind of a sacrifice. That the offering of animals in sacrifice was a Harappan practice is also suggested by certain seals, for example the one from Mohenjo-daro. It depicts a deity in front of whom kneels a devotee. Behind the latter is an animal, in all likelihood brought as an offering.

The art of brick laying was well developed.\\n\\nApart from the mud-bricks, at the drains burnt bricks have been used. This restricted use probably was due to the high cost of burnt bricks and hence the specific usage only.\\n\\nExcepting in the case of drains one course of headers alternating with one course of stretchers is found.', 'The bonding material used is clay, which is grayish or greenish in color. Where water logging had occurred bonding medium turns greenish.\\n\\nIn order to make good the damages to walls of houses as well as street wall faces, occasionally the repair work was done by filling the gaps with clay supported with potsherds, charcoal and gravel and then filled up.\\n\\nOn the road side the street wall itself formed the main house wall. In some areas there were clearly double walls, i.e. a separate house wall was built.\\n\\nFrom the street itself different phases of construction and reconstruction could be seen. During successive periods of occupation of the site, successive levels were built-up.\\n\\nLongish streets, parallel to each other cutting at right angles with lanes belonging to different levels are found.\\n\\nThe floors in the houses are at times made of decorated incised tiles.', 'The floors in the houses are at times made of decorated incised tiles.\\n\\nThe people utilized doorways built in street wall faces itself for entry into house courtyards. In D-3 Qd.3 Trench one such doorway, with its threshold, sill etc. was noticed, and it was about 90 em wide.\\n\\nSmall square rooms were seen more in number.

In the western side the fortification wall was exposed to a length of over 150 m. with a width varying between 3 m. and 3.9 m. The maximum available mud-brick courses were fifteen. Two sizes of bricks, viz., 40x20x10 cm. and 30x15x7.5 cm. were found to have been used. It was discovered that the northern part of the city wall had been built in a box-pattern, with mud filling inside. A gateway about the middle of the fortification wall on this side led to an east-west street. The width of the gateway is 3.7 m. A room, measuring 2.5 x 2.5 m was situated on the interior of the southern flank of the gateway, which seems to have been a guard-room.', \"At KLB-2, the fortification-wall was exposed to a length of over 110 m on the northern periphery. Built in a box-chamber pattern, it had a width varying from 4 to 9.10 m., involving three to four structural phases. On the western side, the fortification-wall was traced. In the course of exposing the western wall in this part of the mound, a heap of baked-bricks seemingly representing a brick-robber's dump, was brought to light. On the eastern side, the remains of the fortification-wall could be traced. Persistent search, however, revealed a cutting-line, running in alignment with the outer toe of the existing fortification-wall on this side, and available to a length of over 30 m beyond the extant remains of the fortification-wall. From its behaviour, it may be surmised that this line represents the builder's layout-mark for the fortification-wall. On the southern side, except for washed mud-brick material, no remains of the fortification-wall could be encountered. It is likely,\", 'washed mud-brick material, no remains of the fortification-wall could be encountered. It is likely, therefore, that the wall on this side may have been completely eroded away.

The main arterial thoroughfare, part of which was excavated to the natural surface, measured over 7 m in width and, throughout the occupation was rigorously maintained without any serious alteration. The only encroachment on the street consisted of the curious rectangular troughs or bazaar platforms outside some of the houses. No street-drains were found; at one place, however, successive drains from a house-block were seen to discharge into the street. The street except for the late phase was un-metalled. On the other hand in front of some of the houses could be seen patches of mud-brick flooring, sometimes with brick-on-edge.', 'Four north-south thoroughfares were exposed in stretches in the southern margin of the city to show its crossings with the earlier-known four north-south thoroughfares. It appears that there were five north-south thoroughfares and four east-west ones along with three or more east-west lanes. Reckoning from the south, this would be the first east-west thoroughfare. At its crossing with the main north-south thoroughfares, remains of wooden fender-posts were found at successive levels of the street corner. Upwards of 70 m. further north, another east-west street was located and consequently exposed to a length of about 50 m., extending up to the eastern margin of the city. Unlike the former east-west thoroughfare, this street did not extend from one end of the city to the other but taking off from a centrally-placed north-south thoroughfare, ran only in the eastern part, and was planned in alignment with a similarly-situated east-west street running in the western part.\\n\\nTRENCH D-9', 'TRENCH D-9\\n\\nLocation KLB-2 Square No. D-9 Quadrants 1, 2 and 4\\n\\nType of structure: Street and lane crossing and house walls\\n\\nStratigraphic position : Level (1) to (3)\\n\\nPeriod and structural phase : Harappan, Phase V\\n\\nMeasurement of structure: (a) length (b) width (c) height As below\\n\\nNumber of courses : 1 to 6\\n\\nMasonry and bond: Header and stretchers, English Bond\\n\\nComposition of mortar: Mud\\n\\nComposition of plaster: No plaster is available\\n\\nOrientation of longer axis : As below\\n\\nNature of bricks used: Mud-bricks\\n\\nDimension of bricks : (a) length 30 cm (b) width 10.5 cm (c) thickness 7.5 cm\\n\\nState of preservation: Fragile\\n\\nShape and other distinguishing features: Between the lane (width not clear) and street corner there is a room of the house.

HOUSES', 'At KLB-2, the excavation uncovered an area of the township with its characteristic chess-board plan. Four arterial thoroughfares running north-south have so far been excavated, and it is surmised that within the unexcavated width of the mound two, if not three, more may be found. The width of the streets and thoroughfares range between 1.80 and 7.20 m and significantly enough approximated to the unit 1.80 m or so. While the north-south thoroughfares were found to run unimpeded, the east-west running lanes or streets did not cut across the former and were staggered in plan. Apart from the rectangular troughs or bazaar-platforms, no other encroachment was noticed in the thoroughfares and streets. In this typical grid layout of the township, each house faced at least two if not three streets, and, with a rectangular plan, consisted of a courtyard often with a well and six or seven rooms aligned on the three sides. Within one of the rooms of almost each house was found the curious', \"aligned on the three sides. Within one of the rooms of almost each house was found the curious 'fire-altar', some time also in successive levels, indicating their recurrent function.\", 'The houses were made of mud-bricks of the house for living, in general, was oriented towards the inner central space, which was entered by turning round the corner. The layout of Mohenjodaro (Fig. 2) and that of Kalibangan li (Fig. 4A) indicate that there must have existed a kind of \"neighborhood privacy\" which is still known to-day in the \"pots\" for example of Ahmedabad which might indicate that special social groups lived in well defused areas.\\n\\nM.

Four blocks of houses, two on courses of headers and stretchers each side of the main street, were thus simulating the characteristic English demarcated. Each block consisted of a series of rooms with a courtyard. The houses were built of mud-bricks of the size of 30 x 15 x 7.5 em, the use of baked-bricks being confined to drains, wells etc.', 'Both on the eastern as also on the western side, the house walls almost reached up to the fortification-wall which was built of mud-bricks of the size of 40 x 20 x 10 em in the lower courses and 30 x 15 x 7.5 em in the upper.', 'The excavation revealed that the block had more houses than one. Entrance to one of the houses was found from the lane. The entrance opened into a corridor, which in turn led to the courtyard. There was no evidence from the corridor into the side rooms. The rooms varied in dimensions, the biggest and a smallest being 3 x 2 m and 2 x 1 m respectively. The rooms were interconnected through doorways. The width of the door varied from 70 em to 75 em. A single socket on the sill of the entrance to a room suggests that probably single-leaf doors were used. In one of the rooms, copper celts, spear-heads, arrow-head, and a steatite seal were recovered from various floor-levels. In a few rooms were also met with circular or oblong mud-lined enclosures within which stood terracotta cylindrical objects associated with ash and charcoal pieces. The area of the courtyard was increased or reduced at different levels. In all the phases, a greenish deposit was found in the courtyard. The green tinge', 'different levels. In all the phases, a greenish deposit was found in the courtyard. The green tinge may be due to the use of dung-plaster on the successive floors of the courtyard.', 'Within the excavated area a side street and two lanes, running east-west, and respectively 3.70 m and 1.60 m wide, were found to open into the main thoroughfare, which, running south-north led from outside to the heart of the.', 'Deep digging in two house-blocks indicated as many as nine structural phases within the Harappan occupation. Although plans of the houses of each phase are still incomplete, it is clear that a courtyard was an essential feature. As regards horizontal digging, the main thoroughfare, exposed earlier (1963), was excavated to a further length of 70m. On the south, thus bringing it almost to the southern margin of the mound, where it was met by a cross-lane. Noteworthy features encountered in the thoroughfare include: pavements of bricks-on-edge; platforms or troughs; soakage-jars with outlets of house-drains and possible entrances. At one of the street-corners, a post-hole for a fender-post was also found, indicative of a busy vehicular traffic necessitating such precautions (Fig. 6.46).\\n\\nDeep digging in the selected area inside a house brought to light plans of different structural phases within the Harappan (Period II) occupation.

The structures consist of streets, lanes, house-walls, house complexes (Phases I, II, III, IV and maximum belongs to phase IX)). It appears that streets and houses and lanes had generally followed the same plan through the different phases with little deviations as per needs of the occupants. Generally the entire area was divided into grids divided by big streets cutting at right angles and the area was further divided by lanes running east-west. Between the lanes three to six houses opening into streets or lanes are found. An average house consisted of five to six rooms around a central courtyard which was having a bread oven.

In this series the first book on Early Harappans had already been published in 2003 by the Archaeological Survey of India as Memoir No 98.\\n\\nIn fact, after the partition (in 1947) extensive explorations were carried out in various places to search Harappan sites in India, since both the major Harappan sites, Mohenjodaro and Harappa, remained with the present‑day Pakistan. Kalibangan was the first Harappan site which was explored and subsequently excavated after Independence, in 1960‑69.\\n\\nThe excavations at Kalibangan have undoubtedly produced very good results and established Fabric A to F in pottery, added a unique finding of the earliest ploughed field from the early Harappan period and traces of earliest earthquake marking the end of the early Harappan and Harappan. Scale, cylindrical seal, charging bull, inscribed pottery, fire‑alters, wells, bathing platforms, linga‑with‑yoni, plumb bob, etc. are the noteworthy findings, along with the plans of citadel, the city and burial ground, from Harappan Period.\\n\\nHowever, for this long‑pending report and its enormous delay, the senior author, Prof. B. B. Lal, states in the Preface of the book: \"Better Late than Never\". The completion of the report has only been possible due to painstaking approach of the authors, after their retirements: Prof. B. B. Lal and Late Shri Jagat Pati Joshi, both former Directors General of Archaeological Survey of India.\\n\\nThis Part‑1 on the Harappans throws light on chronology; three‑mounds concept of the settlement; fortified citadel and city; stratigraphy and structures; chess‑board plan of the city; ritual platform, fire‑altars, wells; representative pottery, plain as well as decorated, with their design‑repertoire; cylindrical seal, square seals and sealings, with scientific studies of steatite seals; crafts and industries.\\n\\nThe academic community which has eagerly been waiting for this report for a long time will surely welcome it.\\n\\nI have great pleasure in placing on record my appreciation of my colleagues in the Archaeological Survey of India, for their joint efforts for the completion of the report. My special thanks are due to Dr. B. R. Mani, Additional Director General, Dr. D. N. Dimri, Director (Publication), Shri Daljit Singh, Superintending Archaeologist (Publication), Shri Vishnu Kant, Assistant Superintending Archaeologist, Delhi Circle, Dr. Sujeet Nayan, Assistant Superintending Archaeologist (Publication), Shri Hoshiar Singh, Production Officer (Publication), Shri Abinash Mohanty, Assistant Archaeologist and others who have provided assistance with ardent zeal in bringing out this publication. M/s. Aravali Printers, New Delhi, deserve my thanks for their co‑operation and publishing this book.\\n\\nPlace: New Delhi\\n\\nDate: 31/01/2015\\n\\n(Rakesh Tewari)\\n\\nDirector General\\n\\nArchaeological Survey of India\\n---\\n•\\n---\\n# PREFACE\\n\\nThe first volume of the report on the excavations at Kalibangan was prepared in 2000 and published by the Archaeological Survey of India in 2003. In it we had given an account of the settlement in so far as it related to the Early Harappan times (Period I). In the present volume, which consists of two parts, we place before the reader an account of the Mature Harappan settlement (Period II). We once again deeply apologize for the inordinate delay in the publication of these two volumes, which has been due to reasons beyond our control, as mentioned in the Preface to earlier volume. However, \"Better late than never\" is the maxim which gives us some solace, and we earnestly hope that the archaeological fraternity will forgive us for the delay.'), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/out.md'}, page_content='As in the case of the earlier volume, in the present one too the credit of organizing the work must go primarily to Shri Jagat Pati Joshi. He has taken pains to piece together the field-drawings, making them presentable. He has also analyzed the stratigraphy of the site, paying attention to each and every trench. Along with Ms Madhu Bala, he has examined the vast store of antiquities recovered from the site, selecting them for the purpose of this report and writing on them. Ms Madhu Bala has also written the chapters on small finds and pottery. Shri A.K. Sharma was in charge of the cemetery area and has contributed a detailed chapter on the burials, besides K.S. Ramachandran who has written on some of the pot-burials excavated by him. Prof. Bala Subramaniam of IIT and Jagat Pati Joshi have contributed a chapter on Harappan measuring instruments from Kalibangan. Way back, in 1955, the late Shri A. Ghosh had carried out explorations in certain parts of the Ghaggar and Drishadvati valleys and had duly recorded his findings in a diary. Since the material is related to the subject-matter of this Report, an opportunity is taken to include here his field-notes, along with a paper on the subject, which he presented at the All India History Congress, Jaipur, on December 29, 1951. Shri R.K. Sharma has carried out detailed scientific studies of the fragments of the seals at the science laboratory of the Archaeological Survey of India, Dehradun (Uttarakhand).\\n\\nBecause of such a diverse authorship, it is but natural that the style of presentation and language vary from chapter to chapter. Further, since the report had to be submitted to the Director General, ASI, by the dead-line of May 2007 and most of the chapters poured in just before that, no worthwhile editing was possible. Thus, the reader is requested to look more for the contents of the chapters rather than go into the nuances of the style and language.\\n\\nAs the seniormost amongst the contributors, I have great pleasure in placing this report in the hands of the reader, hoping once again that we would be forgiven for the extraordinary delay.\\n\\nNew Delhi:\\nMay 30, 2007\\nB.B. Lal\\n---\\nNO_CONTENT_HERE\\n---\\n# ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\\n\\nIn the preparation of this report technical assistance has been received from many persons and the authors would like to record their deep sense of gratitude and appreciation to them.\\n\\nIn the field, Sarvashri N.C. Ghosh, M.D. Khare, C. Margbandhu, J.S. Nigam, B.M. Pande, K. Raghavachary, J.P. Srivastava, K.M. Srivastava and I.K. Sharma, provided field supervision during nine seasons of work, besides students of batches from 1962 to 1969 of the School of Archaeology (now elevated to the Institute of Archaeology) and students of Punjab University, Chandigarh. The survey maps were prepared by Sarvashri S.P. Jain, A.K. Roy and late Vidya Ram. The drawings were prepared by late Rambabu, J.S. Dubey, L. Dutt, Lalit Jain, Mahendra Singh Panesar and late Amir Singh. Late B.P. Asthana, late R. Chatteijee, late V.V. Dutta, late Ranjit Gupta, Late M.B. Limaye and Shri G. Lakshmi Narayan did all the photography in the various field seasons.\\n\\nIn the headquarters, the supervision of drawing work, including their digitization was done by Shri Vijay Kumar. The digital drawings were prepared by Adwin Incorporation, Delhi, Shri Jassuram finalized the sections and S.K. Sharma prepared drawings of distribution map and charts of seals, sealing and graffiti. Shri Puran Chand Mukhia finalized all the drawings and made them press-ready. He also prepared many other drawings of beads and cemetery incorporated in the report. Shri Ramakant Dwivedi, and Dr. Khushal Girhe, of Prehistory Branch, Nagpur prepared drawings of the lithic tools. The small finds were photographed by B.R. Rajput, Ravindra Kumar and R.K. Jatta. The prints and digital photography of the small finds has been done by Rajat Dilwali of Ms. Kinsay Brothers, New Delhi. Shri Vishnu Kant provided assistance in the analysis of inscribed material and preparation of list of figures. Smt. Anjali Negi typed out the entire manuscript with care and precision and made it press-ready on computer. Various services were provided by Smt. Ramkali. Shri Narendra Kumar Sharma has been of considerable assistance in the location and recording of antiquities and pottery which have been stored for years at Purana Qila.'), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/out.md'}, page_content=\"The work could not have been completed if Smt. Kasturi Gupta Menon, lAS and Shri Babu Rajeev, lAS, and the successive Directors General of ASI, had not provided the facilities and infrastructure to the authors at Purana Qila for writing the report. Dr. R.S. Fonia provided infrastructural help to the project. Shri A.K. Sinha, Director (Publication), Dr. B.M. Pandey and Dr. P.K. Trivedi, former Directors (Publication), Dr. Arundhati Baneiji (former Superintending Archaeologist), Dr. Madhulika Samanta (Superintending Archaeologist), Hoshiar Singh (Production Officer) and other officials of the Publication Section rendered valuable assistance.

SUMMARY OF THE RESULTS\\n\\nAlthough in the earlier report on the excavations at Kalibangan we had given a detailed account of the location of the site and its environment, it may not be out of place here to recall some of it, since we don't expect the readers to remember all that; and perhaps some of them may not have even seen the earlier report.1\\n\\nLocated on the left bank of the now-dry Ghaggar (ancient Sarasvati) river in Hanumangarh District of Rajasthan, Kalibangan (Lat. 29° 29 ' N; Long. 74° 08' E) is one of the most important sites excavated on the Indian side of the border after Independence. As would be seen a little later, it has made some very valuable contributions to our knowledge of the Harappan Civilization (also known as the Indus/Indus-Sarasvati Civilization). The site is about 6 km south of the nearest railway station, called Pilibangan, which lies between Hanumangarh and Suratgarh. From Delhi, it is a little over 300 km by road in a north-westerly direction (cf. Fig. 1.1).\\n\\nAs one moves in this area, one sees during the winter season luscious fields of wheat interspersed with those of mustard, the latter welcoming the visitor by waving their lovely yellow flowers. But all this is a recent development. In the 1950s when we were exploring the area we were greeted by nothing but sand, often swirling up in the air and blinding us.\"), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/out.md'}, page_content='The ancient site consists of three mounds (Fig. 4.1). Of these, the one in the middle (called KLB-2) is the largest, though it has been badly eroded on the southern side. It measures approximately 240m east-west and seems to have been not less than 360m north-south. That on the west (called KLB-1) measures roughly 240m north-south and 120m east-west. As would have been observed, the longer axis in both the cases is north-south, i.e. almost at right angles to the adjacent river, which is somewhat unusual, since normally habitations stretch along the river. Anyway, both the mounds rise to a height of approximately 10m above the surrounding plains. The third mound, named KLB-3, is a bit away to the east of KLB-2 and is very much smaller in area, approximately 70m x 50m, and only 2.5m in height. The reason for this small size of the last-named mound lies in the fact that it was not a residential complex but was used only for a limited (ritualistic) purpose.\\n\\n1 B.B. Lal, J.P.

Period I, Early Harappan, datable to circa 3000-2700 BCE; and Period II, Mature Harappan, ascribable to circa 2600-2000 BCE, there being a gap of about a hundred years between the two. The settlement of Period I had to be abandoned around 2700 BCE because of an earthquake, the details of which have been given on pp. 99-100 of the earlier Report. However, here it may be well worth while to recall that this is the earliest evidence of an earthquake, recorded in any archaeological excavation.\\n\\nSince the southern part of KLB-2 has considerably been eroded, it is difficult to estimate the original north-south extent of the settlement. However, as already stated, it is likely to have been about 360m. The fortification-walls on the east and west, though eroded, are traceable in their basal parts, indicating that the east-west extent of KLB-2 was around 240m. It may, incidentally, be added that the fortification-walls did not form a perfect rectangle on plan, but a parallelogram (Fig. 4.1). These walls were made essentially of mud bricks, although at one place a good deal of debris of kiln-fired bricks was also observed immediately by the side of the mud-brick wall, raising a question whether or not a burnt-brick revetment was also provided - maybe at some weaker points. Since the Mature Harappan settlement at Kalibangan lasted over half-a-millennium, parts of the fortification-walls which gave way in the course of time had to be renewed. In these rebuilt parts it was observed that whereas in the earlier construction the size of the bricks used was 10x20x40cm, in the later it was 7.5x15x30cm. However, no great importance need be attached to these sizes: in the initial stage the builders may have thought it appropriate to use large-sized bricks in the massive construction of the fortification and later on when only limited parts were reconstructed, smaller bricks may have been found good enough. It may, however, be added that the residential houses were made by and large of bricks of the smaller size, viz. 7.5x15x30cm.'), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/out.md'}, page_content=\"Of the two parts of the new settlement, that on the east (KLB-2) was what may be called the 'general' habitation area, where merchants, agriculturists and other 'common men' had their houses. It has been nicknamed as the 'Lower Town', as against the other part which has been called the 'Citadel', having a relatively elevated position, high mud-brick-platforms bearing special kinds of structures on them, and a complex system of fortification-walls. (In fact, this kind of differential nomenclature was started long back (1946) when Wheeler duly established the presence of a fortification-wall around Mound AB at Harappa.) However, it is important to note that even of the gateways of the fortifications at least two were clearly identified, one in the north-western part, opening on the river-side, and another on the western side providing.\\n---\\n# Excavations at Kalibangan - The Harappans (1960-69)\\n\\ncommunication with the Citadel, the northern part of which too had a gate on its eastern side. Though the relevant eastern part of KLB-2 was not excavated, it is possible that there was a gateway on this side as well, providing a passage towards KLB-3. Further, since the southern part of KLB-2 is completely eroded, nothing can be said about the existence of a gateway on this side, although common sense would argue for one.\\n\\nIt is interesting to note that the lanes/streets were laid out more or less in a set ratio of width, viz. 1:2:3:4, with the respective measurements being approximately 1.8m, 3.6m, 5.4m and 7.2m. Bullock-carts could easily ply through all these except the lane which was only 1.8m wide. An important feature was noticed at the crossing of the wider streets. At the exterior corners of the houses over there, wooden fender-posts were provided in order to protect the corners from being damaged by vehicular traffic (Fig. 6.46). Also, full care was taken by the civic authorities that no encroachments were made on the streets, although the site witnessed as many as nine structural phases accounting for a total vertical height of about 10m (Fig. 6.3). The only kind of construction to be seen in these streets was that of narrow platforms (chabutanzs) adjacent to the entrances to the houses, which seem to have been used by the occupants for a chit-chat with the neighbours, as is the case even now in the nearby villages. However, these streets are devoid of drains, such as one sees at Mohenjo-daro. The sullage, ejected through house-drains, was deposited in jars placed in pits immediately outside the house (Figs. 6.20 and 6.20(a)); arrangements, however, seem to have existed for the occasional cleaning of the jars.\\n\\nThe streets and lanes, mentioned earlier, divided the town into blocks, each block comprising a few houses. Though the size of the houses varied, depending evidently on the financial status of the respective owners, an average house appears to have consisted of a courtyard, on two or three sides of which there were the living rooms. Sometimes these could be two-deep, i.e. one behind the other. Piercing the wall on the fourth side of\\n---\\n# Introduction And A Summary of the Results\"), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/out.md'}, page_content=\"the courtyard there was a large entrance. The large size of the entrance to these ancient houses may be understood by the analogy of the modem houses in the adjacent villages which too have such large entrances, through which bullock-carts are admitted into the courtyard and parked there. Maybe the same was the practice in the bygone days. Within the courtyard of these (ancient) houses have been discovered elongated troughs made of mud bricks, in a few of which there were also placed the broken lower halves of earthen jars. Once again, on the analogy of what obtains in the courtyards of houses in the adjacent villages, it may well be conjectured that in the third millennium BCE too the Kalibanganites provided fodder and drinking water in these troughs and pots for their cattle. In the courtyard of one of the houses has been discovered a well, lined with wedge-shaped bricks (Figs. 6.4 7 and 6.49), evidently for ready supply of water, even though the river was not far off. Steps in the courtyard, adjacent to one of the rooms, suggest that some of the houses may have been double-storeyed. The evidence available from a collapsed roof suggests that it was constructed by using wooden rafters, bamboos and reeds overlain with clay. Mention may also be made of a house which seems to have belonged to a well-to-do person. It had a flooring of kiln-fired terracotta tiles, decorated with a pleasing design of intersecting circles (Figs. 6.45 and 6.46(a)). In a nearby room there was a pile of jars, evidently used for the storage of grains (Fig. 6.45). Mud or mud bricks were commonly used for flooring purposes. However, in the upper levels of the site a very interesting feature was noted. Over here, the floors consisted of a soling of broken, burnt terracotta nodules interspersed with charcoal, over which was laid a layer of clay. When these were discovered we could not.\\n\\nAnother noteworthy feature of these altars was their placement. These were so located that anyone using them had to face the east—something which may have had an extra significance in the ritual. (Please mark a similar disposition of the seven contiguous fire-altars met with in the Citadel area (Figs. 5.42-5.44).\\n---\\n# Excavations at Kalibangan - The Harappans (1960-69)\\n\\nSome scholars have expressed a view that the fire-altars were cooking hearths. This is not tenable. In the first place, there already existed in the Kalibangan houses U-shaped hearths (chiilhas) used for cooking. Such chiilhas are in use even today and their rims provide a good base for the placement over them of the cooking vessels. On the other hand, the thin and tall stela, present in the centre of each fire-altar, cannot be expected to hold the base of a cooking pot. Why then shy away from accepting new evidence?\\n\\nIn marked contrast to the 'Lower Town' the western part (KLB-1) was consciously located on a higher ground provided by the ruins of the earlier occupation, so as to give it an eminence. As stated earlier, it is being called the 'Citadel'. It was surrounded by a fortification-wall, which covered an area of about 240m north-south and 120m east-west. Rectangular towers were also provided at the corners and on either side of the entrance on the southern side. The complex was further subdivided into two parts by an east-west medial wall, which too was provided with towers. The southern part had many platforms on which special structural features were located.\\n\\nBecause of erosion over the millennia the evidence of the superstructures has been lost in many cases, but at least two of the platforms clearly showed religious association. On one of these, as many as seven contiguous 'fire-altars' were discovered. Though two of these have been disturbed by a subsequent drain, the central stela (now fallen) and fragments of terracotta 'cakes' were discovered in the others. Immediately to the south of these 'altars', the lower half of a jar was found embedded into the ground. It contained ash and charcoal, providing evidence that most probably fire was kept ready.\\n\\nThat animal-sacrifice was a part of the Harappan rituals is indicated not only by certain scenes portrayed on the Harappan seals, but also by the engravings on a terracotta 'cake' found at Kalibangan itself. On one of its sides is depicted a human figure pulling forward an animal by a rope that had been tied around the latter's neck. On the other side is a deity which, on the basis of its posture and head-gear, seems to represent Siva, depicted on so many Harappan seals.\\n\\nThe platforms were separated from one another by passageways, to allow free movement of the worshippers. However, an important point to note is that the only entrance to this platform-complex (from the south), though wide enough, was in a stepped fashion. Such an arrangement debarred any vehicular traffic from getting.\\n---\\n# Introduction And A Summary of the Results\"), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/out.md'}, page_content=\"en try  into  this  complex.  Indeed,  this  was  idea of a  'procession'  seems to find  some sort of  support  from a seal from Mohenjo‑daro which depicts,  in  the upper register,  a  deity  within  a  pipal‑leaf enclosure  and  kneeling  devotee  in front and,  in  the lower register,  seven wig‑wearing  figures,  one  behind  the other,  as  if  in  a  procession.\\n\\nThere was another access into this southern part; that was from the northern section, through the medial wall. But here again it was a stepped entry. So, even from this side vehicles were prohibited.\\n\\nIt would be of further interest to note that on the edge of one of the towers flanking the southern entrance there were post‑holes (Fig. 5.18(a)), suggesting that perhaps on certain ceremonial occasions flags were also flown, their staves being inserted into these holes.\\n\\nThe northern part had an altogether different kind of planning. There were no platforms, but only residential houses, laid out on the two sides of a street that ran in a north‑westerly direction up to a gateway which opened on the river front. Some of these houses were very large, indicating that their occupants must have been some important personages. It has been surmised, though without any inscriptional corroboration, that they were probably priests who supervised the rituals performed on the platforms in the southern part of the complex.\\n\\nThere was yet another notable feature in the northern part. Between the medial wall, separating the above‑mentioned two parts, and the houses in northern part there was a mud‑brick paved street, running east‑west (fig. 5.26). If imagination is given further free run, it may well be that a procession led by the priests marched ceremoniously on this paved passageway and entered the southern part by means of the stepped passage through the medial wall, referred to in one of the preceding paragraphs.\\n\\nTo the east of the Lower Town, at a distance of about 80 metres, there was yet another complex, named KLB‑3. It covered an overall area of about 70 x 50m, of which only a part was excavated. In it no residential houses were met with, but only fire‑altars of which at least five examples were identified, wholly or\\n---\\n# Excavations at Kalibangan - The Harappans (1960-69)\\n\\nPartly. In these, the usual contents, namely a stela, terracotta 'cakes', ash and charcoal were found. Interestingly, a little away from the fire-altars a mud-brick wall was also discovered. Measuring 1.65 m in thickness, it was exposed to a length of about 12m. The exact purpose of this wall, however, remained to be determined. Whatever be the answer to this particular query, it is certain that these fire-altars were used by congregations and not individually by house-holders like the ones found in the Lower Town.\\n\\nAt this point one might ask a question: While the presence of individual fire-altars in the houses in the Lower Town is easily explainable, what is the explanation for the provision of congregational fire-altars in the Citadel on the one hand and in KLB-3 on the other? A variety of guesses can be hazarded. Perhaps one of these may be that while the groups of the fire-altars perched on a high mud-brick platform in the well-fortified Citadel were to be used by the 'high-ups', those located in the lowly area of KLB-3 were meant for the lowly ones of the population, such as those living in the unfortified area to the south of the Citadel. There could be other explanations too, but, I am afraid, all these will remain in the realm of conjecture.\\n\\nOver a dozen examples of Type I graves were excavated. In all these cases the pit was rectangular, with either sharp or rounded-off corners and large enough to take in an extended human body. Usually placed at the bottom of the pit, the body lay supine in an extended position with the head to the north. The face could be skywards or turned to the left or right. In one case, the grave-pit was found lined with mud bricks which were also plastered (Figs. 22.40-22.43).\\n\\nOn the analogy of an example from Harappa, it may not be unjustified to assume that, overlying the grave, there may have been a mud-brick tumulus which, however, has since disappeared because of erosion. The body, as usual, lay supine in an extended pose, the head being to the north but turned westwards. An interesting feature of this grave was that it contained over seventy pots, nearly half of which lay to the north of the head and the rest underneath the body. It may also be noted that in another grave the body lay prone instead of supine and the head was to the south instead of north. Also, the legs and arms were somewhat folded. Had this kind of disposal any significance, or was it a mere aberration?\\n\\nR.E.M. Wheeler, 'Harappa 1946: The Defences and Cemetery R 37', Ancient India, No. 3, Pl. XXXVIII A.\\n---\\n# Introduction And A Summary of the Results\"), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/out.md'}, page_content=\"Within the same area as occupied earlier by the above‑mentioned inhumation graves (Type I), there lay graves which contained no human body‑either complete or even fractional (Type II). But these did contain the usual grave furniture, such as pottery, etc. Of this type, five examples were excavated. In one case, the pit measured 4x2xlm, the longer axis being north‑south. At the bottom were placed a large number of pots spread almost all over the area. As if to complete the grave‑furniture, there were three shell bangles too. Above this material were encountered a series of bands of sand and clay (Fig. 22.58) indicating that the pit remained open for some time, allowing this kind of deposit to accumulate. The pit was finally filled up with earth and clods thereof. In another example of this type, were found a shell bangle, a carnelian bead and a string of steatite beads, besides, of course the usual pottery. Overlying all this stuff were the inevitable bands of sand and clay. In a still more interesting case, the pit measured 5m north‑south, 1.5m east‑west and 1.5m in depth, and, because of its extraordinary depth, was provided with two steps. The pottery and the conspicuously overlying bands of sand and clay were, of course, there. What could indeed be the reason for such graves sans any skeletal remains? Is it that the dead body was first laid in these graves and, after certain rituals, was removed to the regular inhumation graves? Indeed, one guess is as good or bad as another.\\n\\nAnother kind of burial (Type III) encountered so far only at Kalibangan, is equally baffling. In this case, the grave‑pits were circular or ovoid, but never rectangular. More importantly, these also did not contain the dead body. However, the siting of these pits not far away from the other two kinds of graves referred to did not also show up the kinds of bands of sand and clay as were encountered in the graves of Type II. Thus, the functions of Types II and III were clearly different from each other. Could the Type III have been of a somewhat symbolic nature, perhaps associated with those who died elsewhere? Only further work would be able to throw some light on this issue.\\n\\nThe skeletal remains from the graves of Type I have thrown some interesting sidelight. The skull of a child was found to be rather unusually large, perhaps resulting from the accumulation of water in the brain cells - a hydrocephalic case? To treat the same, the Kalibangan 'surgeon' took recourse to trephination, piercing three holes on the right temporal region and branding it with some heated instrument. An example of trephination also comes from Lothal.\\n\\n4 S.R. Rao, 1979, Lothal 1955-62, Vol. I, pp. 145‑46. New Delhi: Archaeological Survey of India.\\n---\\n# Excavations at Kalibangan - The Harappans (1960-69)\\n\\nIn yet another case, a male skeleton bore cut marks near the left knee. The size of the cut incidentally corresponds to that of the blade of an average copper axe of the Harappan period. Perhaps in the course of a quarrel the person was hit by his adversary with an axe, as a result of which there may have been excessive bleeding and the person succumbed to the injury.\\n\\nAfter a study of the skeletons, A.K. Sharma states that the average height of an adult male ranged between 1.55m and 1.75m and of the females between 1.45m and 1.55m. He is also of the view that life-expectancy may not have been more than 55-60 years (cf. Chapter 22).\\n\\nLike any other Harappan site, Kalibangan too yielded a rich harvest of pottery and antiquities. As regards the pottery, it may be stated that since the site was re-occupied hardly within a century of its abandonment by the Early Harappans, the lower levels of KLB-2 contained a mix-up of Early Harappan and Mature Harappan pottery. The former, however, petered out as time passed and only the latter continued. This latter was very profuse and showed a rich variety of painted designs (Chapter 8). The antiquities included, as usual, seals, sealings, inscribed pottery, copper objects, a variety of beads, chert blades and other tools, terracotta figurines and the ubiquitous cakes, etc. All these have been described in the respective chapters. Here we may refer to just a few of them which merit special attention.\"), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/out.md'}, page_content=\"Amongst the seals there is one which is cylindrical in shape and is engraved with an interesting scene (Fig. 9.51). At least shape-wise, though not subject-wise, it reminds us that it is a type which, like the cylinder seal referred to earlier, is unusual in a Harappan assemblage and shows West Asian contacts. Also noteworthy is the occurrence of seven terracotta 'tablets'. These are thin oblong strips, well-fired, bearing in all cases the same inscription and the horn of a unicorn (Figs. 9.77-9.79). These do not bear any impressions of reed or cord on the reverse, as the normal sealings do. Thus, their purpose seems to have been altogether different. In this context, it may be added that all these came from the Citadel, more importantly from an area lying between the ritualistic platforms on the one hand and the houses to the north which may have been occupied by the priests and other elites. Could these then have some kind of special (religious?) significance?\\n\\nOf the inscribed pottery there are at least two examples which deserve special attention. On these the inscriptions were engraved after firing and the noteworthy point is that the signs partially overlap. It has been observed that in all the cases concerned the sign on the right is overridden by the next one on the left. This shows that in each case the sign on the right was inscribed first and then came the one on the left. Such a disposition of the signs conclusively proves that the direction of writing in the Harappan script was from the right to the left (Figs. 9.144 and 9.148).\\n\\nAmongst the other objects, particularly noteworthy is a terracotta example of the Uriga-cum-yoni (Fig. 21.75). Although stone examples, separately of the liriga and yoni, had been found at Mohenjo-daro, this is an example wherein the two go together. Two bulls, one in terracotta (Fig. 21.16) and the other in bronze (Fig. 12.15) are very good examples of Harappan art. Special attention also needs to be drawn to a terracotta kemos, with seven lamps set on the hollow ring (Fig. 21.76) - a type which, like the cylinder seal referred to earlier, is extraneous to the usual Harappan repertoire and points towards West Asian contacts.\\n---\\n# SOME THOUGHTS ON\\n\\n# THE NOW-DRY RIVER ON WHOSE BANK STANDS THE SITE OF KALIBANGAN\\n\\n# B.B. LAL\\n\\n# ITS IDENTIFICATION\\n\\nThe ancient site of Kalibangan stands on the left bank of a river which is now dry, though its bed is about 5 kilometres wide at this point and has been measured even up to 8 km in width elsewhere (cf. Fig. 2.1). Its present name in the Kalibangan region is the Ghaggar but downstream in Cholistan (Pakistan) it is known as the Hakra. Still further down, in Sindh, it goes by yet different names, such as the Raini, Wahinda and Nara. There is geomorphological evidence to show that the river fell into the Rann of Kachchha, an arm of the Arabian Sea (Fig. 2.2).\\n\\nHowever, it is very difficult to find out why and when this same river was given these altogether different names in the various regions. And more important is the question: What was its name when it was flowing and was the life-line of the Early and Mature Harappan people whose settlements, dating back to at least the fourth millennium BCE, prospered all along its bank?\\n\\nPerhaps we have to get back to ancient Indian literature in search of the answer. The earliest text, the Rigveda, has a very famous hymn known as the Nadi-stuti, i.e. 'Prayer to the Rivers'. Its verses, relevant to the present context, run as follows:\\n\\n1 Louis Flam. 1999.

Verse RV 6. 61.2 states:\\n\\niyam SU$mebhirbisakha ivarujat sanu giril)am tavi$ebhiriirmibhibl paravataghnimavase suvriktibhi.b Sarasvatima vivasema dhitibhi/11\\n\\nThis (Sarasvati river) has shattered the mountain peaks with her fast and powerful waves, just (as easily) as one uproots the lotus stems; let us invoke her, who strikes what is far and near, with holy hymns and prayers.\\n\\nAgain, RV 6.61.8 endorses that: yasyii ananto arhutastve$a§chari$1)Uran;ava)l ~charatiroruvatll\\n\\nWhose (i.e. of the Sarasvati) boundless, impetuous and swift-moving flood gushes forth with tempestuous roar.\\n\\nFrom the foregoing it would be abundantly clear that the *Rigvedic* Sarasvati had plenty of water in it, so much so that its fast and powerful currents could sometimes even shatter the peaks of mountains.\\n\\nThat this river flowed all the way down to the sea is also duly vouchsafed by the...\\n---\\nSome thoughts on Now-Dry River on whose Bank Stands the Site of the Kalibangan valley.\\n\\nAs regards the Sutlej having fed the Sarasvati, a noteworthy objection comes from J. Wilson. He draws attention to the absence of any Sutlej-like sandy silt in the bed of the Hakra (by which name the ancient Sarasvati is known in Cholistan) a fact demonstrating that the Sutlej did not join the Sarasvati.\\n\\nWhile it is not proposed to examine here in detail the veracity or otherwise of the Yamuna and Sutlej having fed the ancient Sarasvati, some very elementary points in any case cannot be ignored. No doubt the Drishadvati was a tributary of the Sarasvati in ancient times, as per the Rigvedic text itself, but this former river called Sudanwala. It joins the Ghaggar-Sarasvati combine all the way down near Suratgarh. Thus, it could not have contributed its water to the Sarasvati before that point.\\n\\nNow to the Sutlej. It is believed that in antiquity of course, it flowed successively through what are now known as Eastern Naiwal, Naiwal and Western Naiwal. However, it is well known that even the Eastern Naiwal comes neighbouring area. But when it joined, if it really did, the Ghaggar-Sarasvati combine around Hanumangarh. Thus, neither the Yamuna nor the Sutlej contributed even a drop of water to the Sarasvati during its journey right from the Siwaliks up to Hanumangarh - a stretch of nearly 400 kilometres in which there lay a large number of Early and Mature Harappan sites, such as Kunal, Banawali, etc.\\n\\nIn this context one can do no better than to refer to a most recent study of the problem. It is by two eminent geologists, V.M.K. Puri and V.C. Verma. In their paper, they present a very comprehensive survey of the area involved. However, we give here a brief summary of their findings. The mountainous terrain between the Yamuna and Markanda shows a series of four river-terraces. The authors have numbered these, from top downwards, as T0, T1, T2 and T3. The oldest of these terraces, viz. T0, has been identified at a distance of about 2 kilometres south-southeast of a place that rises to an average height of 660 metres above the mean sea-level (MSL). An important feature of this terrace is that it contains quartzite pebbles and metamorphic rocks, besides, other material. With similar lithological composition, high terraces, T1 and T2 have also been observed.'), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/out.md'}, page_content=\"It has been noted that the kind of exclusive material just referred to in the context of the older terraces does not occur in them. The implications of such a difference in the lithological composition in the respective sets of terraces are of far-reaching significance, and it would be best to quote what these geologists have to say (ibid., p.16).\\n\\nFootnotes:\\n\\n1.

Its dimension was very large as it contained a very high discharge that traversed in its upper reaches a terrain of quartzite and metamorphic rocks. Such a region does exist in central and upper reaches of Yamuna fourth order basin where Central Crystallines and Jutogh group of rocks are located towards north, north-east and eastern side of above-mentioned four terraces. Moreover, in the Paonta valley, there is a clear evidence that prior to the present Yamuna river, there existed a major river channel at a much higher elevation that followed a westerly and southwesterly course through a route now almost completely obliterated on Siwalik platform due to erosion but its terraces are still observed along Adi Badri-Markanda link in the plains immediately to the south of Siwalik belt.\\n---\\nSome Thoughts on Now-Dry River on whose Bank Stands the Kalibangan\\n\\nIn search of the source of this once-mighty river, these geologists draw our attention to the Tons basin where quartzite and metamorphic rocks abound. They then aver: 'All the evidences point to only one conclusion that the present-day Tons was in fact Vedic Sarasvati in its upper reaches.' (ibid., p.16).\\n\\nAfter a further study of the region, these geologists produced a map which shows that the ultimate sources for this Vedic Sarasvati were what are known today as the Sarasvati, Jamadar, Supin and Manjee Glaciers, supplemented by Rupin and Nargani Glaciers. All these glaciers melted near Naitwar and the river thus formed moved first in a southwesterly direction and then in the westerly. Breaking through the Siwaliks near Adh Badri, it finally made its mighty descent on the plains (Fig. 2.3). This, in brief, is the story of perennial water supply to the once mighty Sarasvati which is now represented by mere dry beds, though, as already stated, these are at places as wide as 6-8 kilometres.\\n\\n# HOW AND WHEN DID THE SARASVATI DRY UP?\\n\\nA very relevant question that may now be asked: If the Sarasvati was such a mighty river, how did it dry up? The answer, again, had to be sought through an investigation of the Himalayan Terrain, which the afore-mentioned geologists, Puri and Verma, verily did. According to them, there took place a major seismic upheaval in the Himalayas, as a result of which there arose the Bata-Markanda Divide, nearly 30 metres in height (Fig. 2.4). It blocked the passage of the Sarasvati, which could no longer flow westwards. Since water must find its way out, it flowed backwards and, taking advantage of the Yamuna Tear opening, ended up in a normal process.\\n\\nFurther, as Raikes has very aptly captioned his paper just referred to, viz. 'Kalibangan: Death from Natural causes', the Harappan settlement at Kalibangan came to a sudden end because of the drying up of the Ghaggar, even though it was still in a Mature stage and not decaying.\"), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/out.md'}, page_content='6 Robert Raikes, 1968.

While geologists have not yet come up with any precise dating, archaeologists do have some noteworthy facts and figures to advance, based upon the radiocarbon method of dating. From the data given in detail in Chapter 3, it would be seen that the Mature Harappan settlement at Kalibangan came to a sudden end around 2000 BC. In other words, this was the time when the Sarasvati dried up.\\n\\n# The Emergent Picture\\n\\nFrom what has been stated in the preceding pages the following facts emerge, namely that -'), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/out.md'}, page_content=\"1. The now-dry Ghaggar on whose bank Kalibangan stands was none other than the Sarasvati of the Rigveda;\\n2. It originated in the Himalayas and flowed all the way down to the sea;\\n3. It dried up because of a tectonic upheaval in the Himalayan region which threw up a barrier known as the Bata-Markanda Divide, with the result that the path of the Sarasvati was blocked and its water got diverted to the Yamuna via the Yamuna Tear;\\n4. This drying up of the Sarasvati led to the abandonment of the Mature Harappan settlement at Kalibangan - an event that took place around 2000 BCE, as testified to by the radiocarbon dates.\\n\\nSince the Sarasvati was a mighty river flowing during the Rigvedic times and it dried up around 2000 BCE, the Rigveda has got to be earlier than 2000 BCE. How much earlier, it is anybody's guess.\\n\\nAccording to the famous Nadi-stuti Siikta of the Rigveda (RV 10.75.5-6), the area occupied by the Rigvedic Aryans extended from the upper reaches of the Ganga - Yamuna on the east to the Indus and its western tributaries on the west.\\n\\nA simple question is now posed, viz. which archaeological culture flourished in this very area during the pendency of the Rigvedic times, i.e. prior to 2000 BCE? The inescapable answer will have to be: The Harappan Culture. In other words, the Harappan Culture and Vedic Culture are just two faces of the same coin (Fig. 2.6).\\n\\nFrom time to time certain objections have been raised against the equation set forth in (iii) above. I have dealt exhaustively with the same in my book, The Sarasvati Flows On: The Continuity of Indian Culture (2002; New Delhi: Aryan Books International) and I do not propose to burden the reader by re-hashing the same here. Those interested in the details thereof are requested to go through the relevant parts of that book (pp. 67-77).\\n---\\n# Some Thoughts on Now-Dry River on whose Bank Stands the Site of Kalibangan\\n\\n# RIGVEDIC AREA\\n\\n# Vis-a-vis HARAPPAN CIVILIZATION\\n\\n100 0 100 200 300\\n\\nKm.\\n\\n# SOME HARAPPAN SITES\\n\\n3rd MILLENNIUM BCE\\n\\nFig. 2.6 Map showing a correlation between the Rigvedic area and the spread of the Harappan civilization, in the 3rd millennium BCE\\n\\n21\\n---\\nNO_CONTENT_HERE\\n---\\n# CHRONOLOGICAL HORIZON\\n\\nB.B. LAL\\n\\nThen in the 1920s the Harappan Civilization was discovered it was but much older than the actual time when the wood was burnt, turning it into the charcoal picked up for dating.\\n\\nBesides the foregoing, there have been changes in the half-life value of the carbon as also in the methods of calibration. Thus, at one point of time the half-life value stood at 5568, whereas later on it was upgraded to 5730. In so far as the calibrations are concerned, there have been three so far. As of now, the latest one (Calib-3) is considered to be the most reliable (perhaps awaiting the arrival of a fourth one!). Anyway, this is the one in use now, and is being adopted here in the case of Kalibangan as well.\\n\\nNow we have a method called the Radiocarbon Method, by which organic material, such as charcoal, wood, bone, etc., occurring in various strata is dated, giving what is generally regarded as a method of 'absolute dating'. In this context, however, it needs to be added that though relatively more reliable than the mere 'comparative method', even this method has its own pit-falls. For example, often charcoal samples, on the basis of which the dating rests, have been found contaminated either by roots of living trees which have gone all the way down intermixing with the samples concerned or by the seepage into and consequent absorption by these samples of water containing much later carbonaceous material. Such a mix-up will naturally give a much younger date, dependent on the degree of contamination. On the other hand, the radiocarbon dates can also be thrown back by centuries if the charcoal is contaminated.\\n\\nWe have altogether 28 dates for Period II (i.e. Mature Harappan) of Kalibangan. Based on their stratigraphic horizons, 5 of these samples belong to the Early Levels, while 10 and 13 respectively to Middle and Late. Initially, all these samples were examined by the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research, Bombay and are prefixed with TF in the Table below. However, there is one sample which bears 'P' as a prefix, which stands for the Laboratory of the University of Pennsylvania, where the dating of this particular sample was done. In order to cross-check the TF datings in general, parts of three charcoal samples, belonging one each respectively to Early, Middle and Late Levels, were sent to Birbal Sahni Institute of Palaeobotany, Lucknow. These are marked as TF (BS).

dating and its end-products, it is always necessary to take these dates with a pinch of salt. This becomes clear when we cast a closer glance at them. Thus, for example, a 25th Century BCE horizon is indicated for all the three levels, viz. Early (Sample Nos. TF-163, TF-(BS) 163 and TF-607), Middle (Sample No. TF-608) and Late (Sample Nos. TF-25, TF-153). However, we need not be so despondent, since if we go into the majority of the dates in a given level, we find that the picture is not so bleak. Thus, for the Early Levels, out of the five dates only one (TF-947) is in 22nd Century BCE, while three (TF-607 and TF-163, TF-(BS) 163 are in the 25th Century BCE, and one (TF-160) in the 26th Century BCE. This would imply that the Mature Harappan settlement at Kalibangan may have begun some time in the 26th Century BCE.\\n\\nNow to the likely date of the end of the Mature Harappan settlement at Kalibangan. Here we may straightaway write off AD 80 (TF-599) since it requires no explanation to do so. One would have given some credence to the two late dates, viz. 1516 BCE (TF-244) and 1378/1345/1319 BCE (TF-138), but these are heavily out-voted by ten other dates, viz. TF-942, TF-25, TF-153, P-481, TF-605, TF-150, TF-149, TF(BS)-149, TF-946 and TF-143. Of these ten dates, the first nine fall between the 26th and 20th Century BCE and only one (TF-143) falls in the 19th Century BCE. The consensus of all these dates would, thus, indicate that the end of the Mature Harappan settlement at Kalibangan is not likely to be later than the 20th Century BCE.\\n---\\n0\\n---\\n# THE HARAPPAN SETTLEMENT AT KALIBANGAN- AN OVERVIEW\\n\\n# JAGAT PATI JOSHI\\n\\nThe Harappan settlement at Kalibangan, (Lat. 29°29'N; Long. 74°08'E, Survey Sheet 44 K/SW). District Hanumangarh, Rajasthan is situated on the left bank of the Sarasvati and has been found spread in three mounds presently designated as KLB‑1, KLB‑2 and KLB‑3 having an area of approximately 600 m x 450 m (Fig. 4.1). While in KLB‑1 the Harappan settlement is on the top of Early Harappan occupation, KLB‑2 has given the evidence of Early Harappans and Harappans living together up to middle levels and KLB‑3 has seven fire altars of different types by the side of an enclosure wall and yielded overwhelming Harappan pottery with some Early Harappan pottery indicating use of ritualistic structures by both. It has no residential structures (Figs. 4.2 and 4.3).\"), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/out.md'}, page_content='The northern half on the other rhomb, consisted of residential buildings, perhaps of the elite and had its own street plan with three to four entrances. The fortification wall surrounded the entire citadel having three bastions in the northern side and two salients in the western side with a main stepped entrance on the southern side and a bipartite wall between the two rhombs having two salients and two bastions on the sides having a stepped brick on edge ramp for connecting the two parts. There are two corner bastions on the southern side and one salient and other having an entrance between the two projecting salients steps.\\n\\nWhen the settlement of Early Harappans had reached an average height of 1.60 m above the natural surface, the mound was temporarily abandoned as indicated by thin sandy layers following a seismic catastrophe as evidenced by the faulty strata and Wted one arm of the gateway. The mound was soon re‑occupied by the Harappans and thereafter the structural character of this mound was changed. The settlement in KLB‑1, comprised of a roughly parallelogram on plan, having two almost equal but separately patterned rhombs both of which were enclosed by a fortification wall ranging between 3 to 7 m in width and reinforced at intervals with regular salients.\\n\\nIt is significant that unlike at other Harappan sites, at no place was the fortification wall integral with any of the platforms within the citadel, against the back of...\\n---\\n# RAJASTHAN\\n\\n# 8\\n\\n100            0            100               i2i\\n\\nMETRE\\n\\nFig. 4.1  Kalibagan: Contour plan showing archaeological areas\\n---\\n# The Harappan Settlement At Kalibangan ‑ An Overview\\n\\nFig. 4.2 Kalibangan: General view showing KLB-1 and KLB-2 mounds\\n\\nFig. 4.3 Kalibangan: General view showing KLB-1 and KLB-2 mounds\\n\\n29\\n---\\n# Excavations at Kalibangan - The Harappans (1960-69)\\n\\nThe fortification wall being normal preserved to indicate dimensions, could hardly be reached. No remains of the south-western corner were traced. It was found that a large part of the structure had been completely eroded away. Between the latter and the central salient was exposed another projecting structure retaining four post-holes on the outer edge of the masonry. Its relationship with the fortification nearby and the precise function of the post-holes, have not yet been elucidated. Excavation also revealed that the foundations of both the main fortification-wall and the salient cut through the strata or the structures of the preceding occupation.\\n\\n# 1\\n\\nAt KLB-1, the excavation had indicated the existence of a fortification-wall during the Harappan occupation, thus suggesting its function as a citadel. On the southern side, where its vestiges were easily identified, the wall was excavated to a fortification of over 100 m continuous length salients and a rectangular tower. Two sets of brick sizes (40x20x10 and 30x15x7.5 em), representing margin of couple structural phases, were two principal masonry of this wall. In the earlier phase, the width of the wall showed the use of larger-sized bricks, 7 m, while in the latter, employing the smaller-sized bricks, the width was measured between 9 and 11 m. At some places, further structural sub-division could also be differentiated in the latter phase. The salient projecting 9.35 m from the main face was 17 m and rose imposingly with a battered exterior. Of the south-western corner tower only the projection side was available, the remaining angles being insufficiently preserved.\\n\\n# 2\\n\\nAt KLB-2, the excavation uncovered an area of the township with its characteristic chess-board plan. Four arterial thoroughfares running north-south have so far been excavated, and it is surmised that within the unexcavated width of the mound two, if not three, more may be found. The width of the streets and thoroughfares ranged between 1.80 and 7.20 m and significantly enough approximated to the unit of about 1.80 m. While the north-south thoroughfares were found to run unimpeded, the east-west running lanes or streets did not cut across the former and were staggered in plan. Apart from rectangular platforms, no other encroachment was noticed in the thoroughfares and streets. In this typical grid layout of the township, each house faced at least two, if not three, streets, and with a rectangular plan, consisted of a courtyard often with a well and six or seven rooms aligned on the three sides. Within one of the rooms of almost each house was found the.\\n\\n# Footnote'), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/out.md'}, page_content='From the sites reported, only three excavated sites show the general layout of a \"Citadel\" and \"Lower Town\" (Fig. 1,2,3).

STRATIGRAPHY\\n\\n#### TRENCH ZG-9 & ZH-9, SECTION LOOKING NORTH ACROSS THE FORTIFICATION, Fig. 5.1\\n\\nThis section gives a clear picture of the Early Harappan fortification wall and also shows how the succeeding Harappans built their fortification of the citadel.\\n\\nIn this section there are only two universal layers besides one local layer (IA). Layer (1) consisting of loose eroded material with potsherds and small mud-brick debris. This layer seals the fortification-wall running north-south. It has an average thickness of 20-45 cm. Layer (IA) occurs in the western side of the quadrant. It consists of ash and charcoal with mud-brickbats. It has an average thickness of 100-80 cm. This is a layer occurring below layer (1). It is a uniform compact burnt clay layer with chunks. Here, the width of the Early Harappan fortification is 4 m. The Harappans have added a revetment on the western side having a width of 1.75 m and on the east 1.55 m. The Harappan revetment is cut into the deposit against Early Harappan fortification.\\n\\n#### TRENCH XJ-1, XE-1, E-1, SECTION LOOKING NORTH, Fig. 5.2\\n\\nThis is a section which has been cut across the KLB-1 mound (southern side) showing the rampart, platforms and drains in relation to stratigraphy. This is an important section, which reveals the construction of various structures and their phases. This section cuts the layout of trenches from east to west.\\n\\nThe eastern side of the section between pegs XJ-1 to XH-1 is eroded, but remains of Early Harappan fortification with five courses are available extending in an area of 4.50 m (east-west). However, the overlying Harappan fortification though damaged and eroded is available leaving a basal width of 6.50 m. The two phases of the fortification wall are very well seen in section looking in trenches - XD-2-3.

Kalibangan - The Harappans (1960-69)\\n\\n# EASTERN SIDE\\n\\nOn the eastern side, sufficient stretches of the fortification-wall were traced at more than two places to establish its width and general alignment. At some places, the wall was found to be built on a fairly deep foundation, necessitated perhaps by the uneven and riven surface of the abandoned Early Harappan settlement. The width of the wall, which as elsewhere, showed two principal structural phases ranging between 4 and 5 m. The full length of the eastern side including the north-eastern turn was exposed; this side of the mound is very badly eroded, especially on the lower slopes; only the inner face of the fortification-wall was available, indicated at some places by the bottom course alone. Save at one place, the outer face was too eroded for determining the width of the wall or other features. At the north-eastern turn, the outer angles of the fortification-wall are insufficiently preserved to indicate its dimensions, much less any plan of the corner-tower.\\n\\n# (i) THE FORTIFICATION\\n\\nThe citadel-mound (KLB-1) had already indicated the existence of the fortification-wall on the northern side of the northern half, which was thus shown to be similarly enclosed as the southern half. The entire length of the fortification-wall on the northern side, including the north-western corner bastions was exposed, the details of the north-eastern corner, being insufficiently preserved, remaining undetermined. The wall was found to run parallel to the partition-wall up to a length of about 85 m. from the eastern end; thereafter showed a re-entrant angle within which was located an unpretentious entrance. At the turning, this re-entrant was further marked by a salient in plan, projected nearly 6 m from the main wall. The north-western corner tower showed two projections on the northern side.\\n\\n# NORTHERN SIDE\\n\\nOn the northern side, stretches of the wall were traced to its entire length, and it was found that the wall was built on the existing slope of the preceding occupation, which was often cut through or displaced for the foundations. The inner face of the fortification-wall bore mud-plaster, suggestive of its standing height above the inside ground level. On this side also it was seen that the mud-brick platform within the citadel-complex was not of one build structurally with the fortification-wall, at least in the earlier phase. A reasonably well-preserved angle of a massive mud-brick platform, separated from the fortification-wall by a 2.20 m. wide passage, was exposed to establish the above premises.\\n---\\n# R | V\\n\\n# 1\\n\\n# GROUP-A\\n\\n# GROUP-B\\n\\n# ENTRANCE\\n\\n# GROUP-C\\n\\n# GROUP-E\\n\\n# PLATFORM A\\n\\n# GROUP-F\\n\\n# GROUP G\\n\\n# PLATFORM-D\\n\\n# 1\\n\\n# Ul\\n\\n# PLATFORM-E\\n\\n# GROUP-J\\n\\n# VALIBANGAN 1960-69\\n\\n# JStRICT HANUMANGARH RAJASTHAN\\n\\n# 1B-1\\n\\n# GROUP-K\\n\\n# PLATFORM-F\\n\\n# ENTRANCE\\n\\n# Fic:\\n---\\n96564\\n---\\n# KLB-1 Stratigraphy and Structures\\n\\nFig. 5.8 KLB 1 Tunnel section below the Harappan (Period II) fortification wall on the north showing two successive phases of the early Harappan (Period I) fortification wall, looking north-west\\n\\n47\\n---\\n# Excavations at Kalibangan - The Harappans (1960-69)\\n\\n# Fig. 5.9\\n\\nKLB I Bastion on the southern side\\n\\n# Fig. 5.10\\n\\nKLB 1 Part view of the bastion on the southern side showing structures of different phases\\n\\n48\\n---\\n# KLB-1 Stratigraphy and Structures\\n\\nFig. 5.11 KLB 1 Close-up of batter of the wall northwestern corner tower\\n\\n49\\n---\\n# Excavations at Kalibangan - The Harappans (1960-69)\\n\\nFortification-wall at some places, notably in the central part of its length, showed a battered angle both on the exterior and the interior faces, the taper being obtained by thick coating of mud plaster.

Nevertheless, at the north-western turn, remains of an impressive structure, perhaps part of a corner-tower with a battered exterior were brought to light.

The inner central bastion has a length of 15 m width 9 m and extant height is 5 m with 34 courses of mud bricks. The top of the central bastion is paved with bricks‑on‑edge. To the west of the central bastion there is a stair‑case having 11 steps with a screen wall and the steps lead from east to west with a screen wall of bricks‑on‑edge.

In this entrance-complex again, two structural phases were recognized, of which the earlier consisted of steps of brick (size: 40x20x10 em; riser, 10 em and tread 40 em), and the latter, perhaps of a ramp, screened by a 1.50 m wide wall (brick size: 30x15x7.5 em). The site of an entrance belonging to the later phase of the fortifications was duly located on the southern side, between the central salient and the south-western end. This entrance by virtue of its being an impressive baked brick structure seems to have suffered very badly from modern despoliations. The passage-floor or steps along with its flanking masonry, which were of burnt bricks.\\n\\nIn this connection a few more points may be noted. Entry to the southern rhomb was through two gates, one each on the south and the north. Both the gates were flanked by salient, but the relevant point here is that in both cases there were steps leading up to the actual point of entry through the fortification-wall. Such provision clearly precluded the entry of any vehicular traffic into the southern rhomb. And perhaps this was as it should have been, for no one would appreciate people riding about in vehicles through what may perhaps more appropriately be termed a 'Temple-complex'.\\n\\nThe two entrances while having the common feature of being flanked by salient and provided with steps, showed some noteworthy difference in details. Thus, the staircase leading to the northern entrance was made of mud-brick alone and was not very wide, that on the southern side had mud-brick soiling with burnt-brick veneer, was much wider and had provision for a few landings too. This difference is understandable in the context of the relative use of the two entrances; viz. while the one on the northern side was used by only a limited number of people residing in the northern rhomb, that on the southern side was the real public entry, for all those coming from the 'Lower Town', as well as from the area immediately to the south of the southern rhomb itself. The burnt-brick veneer was evidently provided to meet the much greater wear and tear at this entrance.\\n\\nIn the context of the southern entrance, it may also be noted that on a footing to the east of the two salients flanking it, there were a few regularly spaced circular holes. While more of these holes could not be identified owing to large-scale spoliation of this as well as the western salient, it would appear that these were deliberately planned: a probable use might have been to insert poles, carrying banners at the top. Such a conjecture would seem to fit in with the public religious festivities which are likely to have taken place in the southern rhomb from time to time.\\n\\nOn the northern side of the southern rhomb, almost alongside the exterior face of its fortification-wall, there was a sufficiently wide mud-brick-on-edge pavement. It commenced near the eastern end and, on the basis of the few rows of brick-on-edge found along the exterior of the eastern of the two central salient, may be assumed to have run up to the flight of steps which led to the entrance into the southern rhomb from this side. One is tempted to surmise that on specified.\\n---\\nKLB-1 Stratigraphy and Structures\\n\\noccasions, there marched, on this paved pathway, a procession of priests, perhaps led by the high priest, and walking up along the flight of steps it entered the 'temple complex' of the southern rhomb, where the priests ascended one or separate platforms to perform or preside over the rituals. The laity by then had perhaps already gathered within the complex, entering it through the southern gate.\"), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/out.md'}, page_content=\"It has already been mentioned above that though the northern rhomb was also fortified, the fortification-wall in its case was, as it were, a supplement or extension of that surrounding the southern rhomb. (It may be recalled that the two central salients of the bipartite wall projected outwards into the northern rhomb, which gave the southern rhomb its primary status.) Within the northern rhomb there were no platforms, no congregational 'fire-altars', no sacrificial pits, but only residential houses planned on either side of a street which, starting off from near the eastern of the two central salients of the bipartite wall led to a river-side exit on the north-west. In these houses there evidently dwelt the priests and others connected with the administering of the rituals in the southern rhomb. There are a number of bath platforms, drains and an imposing double storeyed home perhaps belonging to an important person. One may also reasonably infer that in a priest-dominated society, such as the Indus one seems to have been, the civic administration also may have been handled, partly, largely or even wholly by these very priests. However, how priesthood was handed down and how the head priest, if any, was appointed will remain matters for guess work, at least until the seals begin to speak; or may be these too remain silent on this particular point.\\n\\nIn view of the foregoing, would it not be desirable to re-think about calling the western wing of the settlement the 'Citadel'— a term which usually implies a fortified seat of the king of chieftain in a purely political sense? To continue to regard it as the 'Citadel' would be to continue absorbing to the Indus Civilization, a polity, which the evidence does not seem to warrant. And it is this concept of the 'Citadel', which has been magnified into regarding it a 'well protected government headquarters either central or provincial'.\\n\\nA large number of structures have been found at the citadel mound KLB-1 at Kalibangan during the Harappan Period. These have been designated in a two fold method, (i) The prominent structures, fortification wall, entrances, bipartite wall, bastions are marked as such and described; (ii) The other structures are marked and described groupwise. The various platforms in the ritualistic area are alphabetically marked and described in the catalogue. Thus the structures are divided into four groups i.e. A, B, C and D and in the Southern Rhomb, in the ritualistic area are seven groups i.e. E, F, G, H, I, J and K.\\n\\n## CATALOGUE OF STRUCTURES\\n\\n### FORTIFICATION WALL AND BASTIONS\\n\\n#### 1.

One first phase was built on layer 18, Layers 17, 16, 15, 14, 13, 12 and 10 are contemporary and layer 9 seals it. The latter platforms are built on layer 8. Layers 7, 6, 5 and 4 are contemporary and layer 3 seals it (see section looking north)\\n\\nThe mud brick platform in the north eastern part of the southern half of the citadel was determined, on further excavation found to be 75.70 m. x 24 m (earlier reported 60 m. in Indian Archaeology - when not exposed fully). The longer axis being along east-west. Its three angles along could be recovered, the 4th viz. north-western, having been eroded away. The platform has two structural phases. The width of the passage running between this platform and other lying to the south, was found to be 10 m. In its earlier phase part of the passage was seen to be paved with mud bricks. On the extent the platform obviously belonging to the upper levels of occupation was found.\\n\\nThere were no residential buildings in this area. The platforms are marked as A, B, C, D, E, and F in the plan. The available sizes along with the passage are as below belonging to both phases (as available):-\\n\\n| No. of Platform | Size                                            | Height        |\\n| --------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | ------------- |\\n| A               | 75.70 m x 24 m<br/>Passage 10 m<br/>(earlier)   | 1.90 - 2.67 m |\\n| B               | 30 x 20 m<br/>Passage 3.40 m<br/>(later)        | 1.20 - 2.50   |\\n| C               | 30 m x 11 m<br/>Passage 5.30 m<br/>(later)      | 1.30 - 2.40   |\\n| D               | 30 m x 10.60 m<br/>Passage 3.40 m<br/>(later)   | 1.20 - 2.30   |\\n| E               | 30 x 25 m<br/>Passage not<br/>clearly discerned | 1.15 - 2.20   |\\n| F               | 12 x 11 m<br/>Passage not<br/>clearly discerned | 1.20 - 2.30   |\\n\\n(i) Group E: Well The platform which is situated in trench YA-4 has a well of baked wedge-shaped bricks laid horizontally. It is sealed by layer 5. The width of the ring of the well is 30 cm. and supported by four radial walls having a width of 27 cm. The inner diameter of the well is 1.25 m and outer diameter is 1.85 m. It appears that at the outset of the buildings the well a huge foundation was dug and these supporting radial walls were constructed to give further strength to the wall. The well had 86 available exposed courses and so the radial walls but the bricks have been robbed. This has been an unusual construction. It appears that after the construction of the radial walls the in between space was filled up gradually with the gaining of additional height during the\\n---\\n# Fig. 5.29\\n\\nKLB 1 Section against the excavated mud-brick platform with two principal structural phases, looking north-west\\n---\\n# Excavations at Kalibangan - The Harappans (1960-69)\\n\\n88\\n---\\n# KLB-1  Stratigraphy and Structures\\n\\n# Fig. 5.31  KLB  1Section across the mud-brick platform\\n\\n89\\n---\\n# Excavations at Kalibangan - The Harappans (1960-69)\\n\\nConstruction.

There is a covered drain to carry water and perhaps blood of the sacrificed animal. There is platform measuring 12 x 10 cm outside the sacrificial pit. There is a drain bisecting the platform which is 5.60 m x 0.60 m wide. Towards east there is a platform and wall. There are two drains on the platform covered with bricks-on-edge. The area covered by the platform having brick-on-edge is 5 x 5 x 3.50 m.\\n\\n# Group G\\n\\nThis group consists of drains of various phases, bathing platforms, a well, 7 fire altars (two disturbed by the drain) in an area of about 4 m. There are many bathing platforms but these are damaged. The orientation of drains is north-south and east-west in different phases. The bigger drains are oriented in east-west direction.\\n\\n# Well\\n\\nTo the west of fire altars, at the back of the worshipper, there was a well having an inner diameter of 1.60 m and outer diameter of 2.40 m, having wedge-shaped bricks in its construction.

At least five bathing platforms measuring 1x1 m to 1x1.60 m are available. There may be more such bathing platforms which remains now robbed by the brick robbers. Lal mentions :\\n\\n\"To take up the nature of the remains on the top of another such platform within the southern rhomb. On it were noted only a well and a \\'fire-altar\\', but something more: it was a rectangular pit, measuring 1.25 x 1m and lined with kiln-burnt bricks. Within it lay bovine bones and antlers, evidently representing some kind of a sacrifice. That the offering of animals in sacrifice was a Harappan practice is also suggested by certain seals, for example the one from Mohenjo-daro. It depicts a deity in front of whom kneels a devotee. Behind the latter is an animal, in all likelihood brought as an offering. (Incidentally, in the register below stand seven worshippers in a row—a significant number to which reference has already been made above)\".\\n\\n## CATALOGUE OF STRUCTURES\\n\\n### 26. TRENCH NO.

The bricks are wedge-shaped and plain. Originally the width on all sides was .40 m. Later on the width was increased eastern side by 35.40 em. On the northern and western side two small platforms are attached to the pit. The size of the small platform is .65 x .65 m. These platforms were perhaps used by the persons doing the sacrifice. On the south-western corner there is a covered drain attached to the pit running west perhaps for the drainage of water and blood of the animals. Presently the pit has a depth of 60 em. The upper courses have been robbed. The working level of the pit is the bottom of the drain. The pit was found containing bones of bovines and antler. No ash or charcoal was found inside the pit. The bones have cut marks. To the south of the altar there was a platform on brick-on-edge roughly measuring 12 x 10 m. There was an ash pit outside the sacrificial pit. This has some ritualistic purpose. In the east there is a drain running east-west bisecting the platform of brick-on-edge. It is 20 m. long and covered. Towards east there was\\n\\n# 29. TRENCH NO.

These pits are clay-lined measuring 75 x 55 cm with ash and terracotta cakes around a stella in the centre. The stella stood vertically. It is either cylindrical or faceted and measured 30-40 cm in height and 10-15 cm in diameter. The row of the fire altars is located north-south with burnt brick wall. There is a broken pot embedded in the ground full of ash and charcoal. Slightly away is a well and few bath platforms though dilapidated which are connected to a series of drains. Bathing perhaps appears to be ritual connected with the worship at the fire altars. Views have been expressed by certain scholars that these fire-altars were cooking ovens. This view is untenable because the central stella, which is slender and tall, cannot hold any utensil/pot over it, which would always be in danger of falling.\\n\\n37. TRENCH NO.

OF STRUCTURES:\\n\\n1. Occupants of Kalibangan had mostly mud walled structures built of mud bricks.\\n2. Fortification gateways has guard rooms.\\n3. The mud-brick structures were usually plastered with clay.\\n4. Mud-brick and terracotta cakes were utilized as road metal in the roads.\\n5. The usual size of the bricks is 30x15x7.5 em; 40x20x10 em.\\n6. The quality of the bricks shows uniformity in size and finish. The art of brick laying was well developed.\\n7. Apart from the mud-bricks, at the drains burnt bricks have been used. This restricted use probably was due to the high cost of burnt bricks and hence the specific usage only.\\n8. Excepting in the case of drains one course of headers alternating with one course of stretchers is found.\\n9. The bonding material used is clay, which is grayish or greenish in color. Where water logging had occurred bonding medium turns greenish.\\n10. In order to make good the damages to walls of houses as well as street wall faces, occasionally the repair work was done by filling the gaps with clay supported with potsherds, charcoal and gravel and then filled up.\\n11. On the road side the street wall itself formed the main house wall. In some areas there were clearly double walls, i.e. a separate house wall was built.\\n12. From the street itself different phases of construction and reconstruction could be seen. During successive periods of occupation of the site, successive levels were built-up.\\n13. Longish streets, parallel to each other cutting at right angles with lanes belonging to different levels are found.\\n14. The floors in the houses are at times made of decorated incised tiles.\\n15. The people utilized doorways built in street wall faces itself for entry into house courtyards. In D-3 Qd.3 Trench one such doorway, with its threshold, sill etc. was noticed, and it was about 90 em wide.\\n16. Small square rooms were seen more in number. Average size of the rooms from the excavated trenches shows ones with 5sq. m or even less.\\n17. At successive road levels, the roads were made of gravel, potsherds, charcoal, etc. to give strength and support for road usage.\\n18. The houses were single or double storeyed. Steps show that these were meant for going to the p t floor. The houses were probably having flat roof made of timber wattle and daub.\\n19. Besides brick drains, scooped timber drains are also found and terracotta pipes were also used.\\n---\\n# ENTRANCE\\n\\n# KALIBANGAN 1960-69\\n\\n# DISTRICT HANUMANGARH; RAJASTHAN\\n\\n# KLB-2\\n\\n# Lower CITY\\n---\\n..\\n---\\n# KLB-2 Stratigraphy and Structures\\n\\n20. Four road levels are available on streets of phase IX: ZA‑17, YC‑16, YB‑16 and YB‑15, YG‑2, YG‑1, XG‑1, YF‑2, YF‑1 and XF‑1.\\n\\n21. Roads of the streets in the earlier phases were not paved.\\n\\n22.

In the western side the fortification wall was exposed to a length of over 150 m. with a width varying between 3 m. and 3.9 m. The maximum available mud-brick courses were fifteen. Two sizes of bricks, viz., 40x20x10 cm. and 30x15x7.5 cm. were found to have been used. It was discovered that the northern part of the city wall had been built in a box-pattern, with mud filling inside. A gateway about the middle of the fortification wall on this side led to an east-west street. The width of the gateway is 3.7 m. A room, measuring 2.5 x 2.5 m was situated on the interior of the southern flank of the gateway, which seems to have been a guard-room.\\n\\nAt KLB-2, the fortification-wall was exposed to a length of over 110 m on the northern periphery. Built in a box-chamber pattern, it had a width varying from 4 to 9.10 m., involving three to four structural phases. On the western side, the fortification-wall was traced. In the course of exposing the western wall in this part of the mound, a heap of baked-bricks seemingly representing a brick-robber's dump, was brought to light. On the eastern side, the remains of the fortification-wall could be traced. Persistent search, however, revealed a cutting-line, running in alignment with the outer toe of the existing fortification-wall on this side, and available to a length of over 30 m beyond the extant remains of the fortification-wall. From its behaviour, it may be surmised that this line represents the builder's layout-mark for the fortification-wall. On the southern side, except for washed mud-brick material, no remains of the fortification-wall could be encountered. It is likely, therefore, that the wall on this side may have been completely eroded away. Its\\n---\\n# KLB-2 Stratigraphy and Structures\\n\\n# XG‑2 All Quadrants\\n\\n1.

It has two entrance's arms the bastion. The fortification-wall are connected with fortification on both sides. This Phases I though eroded belongs to earlier and II. This entrance was open to two streets but later on blocked by houses in II and III phases and there was no vehicular traffic in two streets running north-south and quite a few houses were built having 5 to 7 rooms belonging to later phases. These could be a check post. The size of rooms was 2.50 to 3 m which are mostly square. The main north-south thoroughfare revealed houses on both sides. These are partially exposed. The size of fortification-wall on both sides is having a width of 3 m.\\n\\n# 15. References:\\n\\nM. Jansen, 'Settlement pattern in Harappan Culture', South Asian Archaeology 1979 (Ed. H. Hartel).

The main arterial thoroughfare, part of which was excavated to the natural surface, measured over 7 m in width and, throughout the occupation was rigorously maintained without any serious alteration. The only encroachment on the street consisted of the curious rectangular troughs or bazaar platforms outside some of the houses. No street-drains were found; at one place, however, successive drains from a house-block were seen to discharge into the street. The street except for the late phase was un-metalled. On the other hand in front of some of the houses could be seen patches of mud-brick flooring, sometimes with brick-on-edge.\"), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/out.md'}, page_content='Four north-south thoroughfares were exposed in stretches in the southern margin of the city to show its crossings with the earlier-known four north-south thoroughfares. It appears that there were five north-south thoroughfares and four east-west ones along with three or more east-west lanes. Reckoning from the south, this would be the first east-west thoroughfare. At its crossing with the main north-south thoroughfares, remains of wooden fender-posts were found at successive levels of the street corner. Upwards of 70 m. further north, another east-west street was located and consequently exposed to a length of about 50 m., extending up to the eastern margin of the city. Unlike the former east-west thoroughfare, this street did not extend from one end of the city to the other but taking off from a centrally-placed north-south thoroughfare, ran only in the eastern part, and was planned in alignment with a similarly-situated east-west street running in the western part.\\n\\n5.

HOUSES'), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/out.md'}, page_content='At KLB-2, the excavation uncovered an area of the township with its characteristic chess-board plan. Four arterial thoroughfares running north-south have so far been excavated, and it is surmised that within the unexcavated width of the mound two, if not three, more may be found. The width of the streets and thoroughfares range between 1.80 and 7.20 m and significantly enough approximated to the unit 1.80 m or so. While the north-south thoroughfares were found to run unimpeded, the east-west running lanes or streets did not cut across the former and were staggered in plan. Apart from the rectangular troughs or bazaar-platforms, no other encroachment was noticed in the thoroughfares and streets. In this typical grid layout of the township, each house faced at least two if not three streets, and, with a rectangular plan, consisted of a courtyard often with a well and six or seven rooms aligned on the three sides. Within one of the rooms of almost each house was found the curious \\'fire-altar\\', some time also in successive levels, indicating their recurrent function.\\n\\nThe houses were made of mud-bricks of the house for living, in general, was oriented towards the inner central space, which was entered by turning round the corner. The layout of Mohenjodaro (Fig. 2) and that of Kalibangan li (Fig. 4A) indicate that there must have existed a kind of \"neighborhood privacy\" which is still known to-day in the \"pots\" for example of Ahmedabad which might indicate that special social groups lived in well defused areas.\\n\\nM.

Four blocks of houses, two on courses of headers and stretchers each side of the main street, were thus simulating the characteristic English demarcated. Each block consisted of a series of rooms with a courtyard. The houses were built of mud-bricks of the size of 30 x 15 x 7.5 em, the use of baked-bricks being confined to drains, wells etc.\\n\\nBoth on the eastern as also on the western side, the house walls almost reached up to the fortification-wall which was built of mud-bricks of the size of 40 x 20 x 10 em in the lower courses and 30 x 15 x 7.5 em in the upper.\\n\\nThe excavation revealed that the block had more houses than one. Entrance to one of the houses was found from the lane. The entrance opened into a corridor, which in turn led to the courtyard. There was no evidence from the corridor into the side rooms. The rooms varied in dimensions, the biggest and a smallest being 3 x 2 m and 2 x 1 m respectively. The rooms were interconnected through doorways. The width of the door varied from 70 em to 75 em. A single socket on the sill of the entrance to a room suggests that probably single-leaf doors were used. In one of the rooms, copper celts, spear-heads, arrow-head, and a steatite seal were recovered from various floor-levels. In a few rooms were also met with circular or oblong mud-lined enclosures within which stood terracotta cylindrical objects associated with ash and charcoal pieces. The area of the courtyard was increased or reduced at different levels. In all the phases, a greenish deposit was found in the courtyard. The green tinge may be due to the use of dung-plaster on the successive floors of the courtyard.\\n\\nWithin the excavated area a side street and two lanes, running east-west, and respectively 3.70 m and 1.60 m wide, were found to open into the main thoroughfare, which, running south-north led from outside to the heart of the.\\n\\nDeep digging in two house-blocks indicated as many as nine structural phases within the Harappan occupation. Although plans of the houses of each phase are still incomplete, it is clear that a courtyard was an essential feature. As regards horizontal digging, the main thoroughfare, exposed earlier (1963), was excavated to a further length of 70m. On the south, thus bringing it almost to the southern margin of the mound, where it was met by a cross-lane. Noteworthy features encountered in the thoroughfare include: pavements of bricks-on-edge; platforms or troughs; soakage-jars with outlets of house-drains and possible entrances. At one of the street-corners, a post-hole for a fender-post was also found, indicative of a busy vehicular traffic necessitating such precautions (Fig. 6.46).\\n\\nDeep digging in the selected area inside a house brought to light plans of different structural phases within the Harappan (Period II) occupation.

The structures consist of streets, lanes, house-walls, house complexes (Phases I, II, III, IV and maximum belongs to phase IX)). It appears that streets and houses and lanes had generally followed the same plan through the different phases with little deviations as per needs of the occupants. Generally the entire area was divided into grids divided by big streets cutting at right angles and the area was further divided by lanes running east-west. Between the lanes three to six houses opening into streets or lanes are found. An average house consisted of five to six rooms around a central courtyard which was having a bread oven.

As would be seen a little later, it has made some very valuable contributions to our knowledge of the Harappan Civilization (also known as the Indus/Indus-Sarasvati Civilization). The site is about 6 km south of the nearest railway station, called Pilibangan, which lies between Hanumangarh and Suratgarh.
